            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>THe Church, from the firſt and moſt early Ages of Chriſtianity, has been conſtantly furniſhed with ſome Learned Men, by whoſe diligent care the Sacred Writings have been purged from thoſe Faults, which by the tract of Time have inſenſibly crept into them. This kind of Labour, which requires an exact know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of Books, joyned with a ſtrict enquiring into the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts, is termed <hi>Critical;</hi> in as much as it Judges and Determines the moſt Authentick Readings, which ought to be inſerted into the Text. By this means <hi>Origen</hi> acquired his Reputation, not only in <hi>Greece,</hi> but univerſally over the Eaſtern part of the World, where the Bibles of his Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction are by the general conſent preferred to all others.</p>
                  <p>St <hi>Jerom,</hi> who may juſtly be ſtiled the Latin <hi>Origen,</hi> has done very great Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to the Weſtern Church, by his <hi>Critical</hi> Correction of the Latin Bibles, in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe in thoſe Churches. Pope <hi>Damaſus,</hi> very ſenſible of his profound Learning, obliged him to review the ancient Latin Verſion of the Goſpels, which was then in a very miſerable Condition. This look'd like too bold an Attempt, and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed above the force of any private Perſon, who could never hope to eſcape the Hatred of a multitude of Perſons in the free exerciſing his Cenſure of Books, which had long ſtood in the peaceable Poſſeſſion of an univerſal Reputation.</p>
                  <p>In ſhort, though it might perhaps be for the benefit of the Church, it was yet a dangerous matter to attempt a Reformation of thoſe ancient Errors, which derive their Authority from their Age. <hi>Pius Labor,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hieron. Praef. in Evang. ad Dam.</note> 
                     <hi>ſed periculoſa praeſumptio judicare de caeteris, ipſum ab omnibus judicandum, ſenis mutare linguam, &amp; caneſeentem jam mundum ad initia retranere parvulorum.</hi> ['Tis a pious Work, (ſays that ancient Father) but very hazardous, that he expoſes himſelf to the univerſal Cenſure, who teaches old Men to change their Language, and reduce the decaying World to a State of Infancy.] But conſidering on the one Hand the powerful Protection and Patronage of ſo great a <hi>Pope,</hi> and being on the other abundantly convinc'd of the manifeſt defect of that Tranſlation, which had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed univerſally in the Weſt; he reſolved rather to expoſe himſelf to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of an infinite number of ignorant Perſons, than fail in the diſcharge of his<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Quis enim doctus pariter vel indoctus, cùm in manus volumen aſſumpſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, &amp; à ſalivâ quam ſemel imbibit viderit diſcrepare quod latitat, non ſtatim erumpat in vocem, me falfarium, me clamitans elle ſacrilegum, qui audeam ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid in veteribus libris addere, mutare, corrigere? <hi>Hieron. Praef. in Evang. ad Dam.</hi>
                     </note> Duty. He knew very well the charge of Innovation and Forgery, that would be
<pb facs="tcp:96711:3"/>drawn up againſt him for endeavouring to alter thoſe ancient Books, which till his time had remained perfectly inviolable. But here he encouraged himſelf by the Precedents of <hi>Origen, Pierius,</hi> and ſome other able Criticks, who had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the very ſame thing in the <hi>Greek</hi> Original, which he then attempted in the Latin Copies of the Goſpel. For which reaſon he ſtoutly depoſed all thoſe which after his Reformation remained Bigots to the ancient Latine Verſion. <hi>Revertimur ad noſtros bipedes aſellos,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hieron. Epiſt. ad Marcell.</note> 
                     <hi>&amp; illorum in aure buccinâ magis quàm ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharâ concrepamus. Illi legant,</hi> ſpe gaudentes, tempori ſervientes <hi>nos legamus,</hi> ſpe gaudentes, Domino ſervientes.</p>
                  <p>But time did Juſtice to that Father. And 'tis a very difficult matter at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, to find any Copies of that Latine Verſion, which was then in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe in the Weſtern Church. Yet enough there are extant to be read as a Memorial to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince thoſe who defend Errors meerly out of Veneration for their Antiquity, that St. <hi>Jerome</hi> has done the Church no ſmall Service, in <hi>Correcting</hi> and <hi>Reviewing</hi> the ancient Latine Copies, according to the ſtricteſt Rules of Criticiſm. This we endeavour to demonſtrate in this work, and that the moſt ancient <hi>Greek</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplars of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> are not the beſt, ſince they are ſuited to thoſe Latine Copies, which St. <hi>Jerome</hi> found ſo degenerous as to need an Alteration.</p>
                  <p>Father <hi>Morin,</hi> and after him Father <hi>Amelot,</hi> who take ſuch pride in thoſe <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Venerable Manuſcripts,</hi> on account of their great Antiquity, never mind, that a thouſand or twelve hundred years can never warrant them cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, ſince there is evident proof of their Corruption before that time. It was neceſſary that I ſhould examine to the bottom, the Circumſtances of theſe <hi>Greek</hi> Texts, which have been produced to this Time. It is not ſufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult thoſe Manuſcripts with deſign only to mark their Antiquity, and quote the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Readings. There is required a great deal of Diſcretion and Judgment, otherwiſe we ſhall miſtake thoſe Books which are altered, for Primitive and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical Exemplars, which is the Caſe of the two Authors we are about to name.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> who was well enough furniſhed with thoſe ſorts of Manuſcripts, is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs guilty of very groſs Errors. He accuſes the <hi>Greeks</hi> without reaſon, for cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting in ſome places, their Copies by thoſe of the Latin, after their Re-union with the Roman Church. This groundleſs Accuſation can proceed from nothing, but the want of knowledge of the Criticiſms of thoſe Copies, which he conſulted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Beza,</hi> who was Maſter of a greater Collection of Manuſcripts of the <hi>New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> than <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> though aſſiſted too by both <hi>Robert</hi> and <hi>Henry Stephens,</hi> has not well diſtinguiſhed the worth of his Manuſcript Copies, whence I found my ſelf in ſome places obliged to correct his Errors. This Man was ſo prejudiced by his Religion, as to accuſe the <hi>Italians</hi> of Corrupting the old Text, and forcing it to a Compliance with their Opinions.</p>
                  <p>This Critical Hiſtory contains divers other Remarks of the like Nature, upon the Manuſcript Copies of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> both in Greek and Latine. My principal aim is to write a Supplement to the Defects of thoſe who compile the different Readings out of the Manuſcripts, without diſtinguiſhing the Good from the Bad. To which intent, it is neceſſary to read a great quantity, and nearly examine them in a Critical manner. This Art, whoſe difficulty appears formidable to ſome Divines in this Age, made part of their Occupation of ſome Ladies in St. <hi>Jerome</hi>'s time: Who not content to read, the Scripture in the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Tongue, diſperſed among the People, they diligently enquired after the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteſt Copies, learning thoſe very Tongues in which they were writ.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:96711:3"/>
                  <p>I aſſert nothing, which cannot be maintained by the Letters of thoſe Pious Ladies, and the anſwers of that Learned Father, who has had oftentimes a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult Task to ſatisfie thoſe Queſtions they propoſe on matters purely Critical. St. <hi>Jerome</hi> had advanced, that the Apoſtles had never cited any Paſſage in the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> which did not perfectly agree with the Hebrew Text. <hi>Euſtochium,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hieron. Prooem. in lib. 16. Comm. in Iſai.</note> who perfectly underſtood the Greek and Hebrew Languages, oppoſed him with ſuch powerful Arguments, that he was forced to own himſelf almoſt overcome with the ſtrength of her Objections. <hi>Quod cùm audiſſem, quaſi à fortiſſimo pugile percuſſus eſſem coepi tacitus aeſtuare.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is no ſtrange thing to find thoſe Ages, when Barbariſm reigned over all <hi>Europe,</hi> neglect Critical Studies. Then they wanted abundance of thoſe helps, which they now enjoy to purſue thoſe Studies, which are abſolutely neceſſary to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Knowledg of Divinity. But that which amazes me, is, that in this very Age, this Art ſhould ſtill remain in contempt; and thoſe Men be thought no more than Grammarians, who apply themſelves to it. Beſides, we cannot but ſee the manifeſt Errors of ſome Divines in this Age, who know not the true Laws of <hi>Criticiſm.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is worth obſerving, that the ancient Hereticks have been perpetually ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of having corrupted the Books of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> and perverted them to their own ſence. That has often been thought a wilful and deſigned Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which proceeded only from the fault of the Tranſcribers, or diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Copies. The Eccleſiaſtical Writers of the firſt Ages have not done that ſtrict Juſtice to the Hereticks of their times, in relation to the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> that they have given the <hi>Jews</hi> in the Diſputes about the different manners of explaining the <hi>Old Teſtament.</hi> Thoſe pretended Corruptions preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vaniſh upon Examination of the ancient Manuſcripts, and the Original of the various Readings. Wherefore in this Piece I have juſtified the Arrians, Neſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, and the reſt of the Sectaries from that Imputation of having falſified the Originals of the Evangeliſts and Apoſtles, to maintain their Innovations. We have alſo plainly evinc'd, by ſome conſiderable Examples, that the moſt Learned Criticks of our Age are not exempted from thoſe Prejudices in their declaring too freely thoſe Hereticks falſifiers of the Text.</p>
                  <p>The caſe of ſome other Sectaries is not the ſame, who declared themſelves open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt the Writings of Chriſt's Diſciples, which they have corrected and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered according to their own Idea's of the Chriſtian Religion. Some daring to forge Suppoſititious Goſpels, and Acts, the better to give authority to their Foppe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. It would be very pertinent, for the better Diſtinction of all the Genuine Pieces of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> to make a Collection of thoſe ancient Acts, and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently examine them. Wherefore we have not concealed any of thoſe Arguments which thoſe Hereticks, or the other Enemies of Chriſtianity have brought to deſtroy the Truth of thoſe Books, which were received by all the Catholick Churches.</p>
                  <p>But as it would be a pernicious thing to expoſe theſe ill things, without ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtring Remedies too proper for the cure, we have alſo produced the ſtrongeſt Reaſons which the Eccleſiaſtical Writers have brought againſt them. We intreat the Proteſtants to make Reflection on theſe matters, and obſerve thoſe methods of the firſt Ages of the Church, for eſtabliſhing the Authority of the Sacred Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings. They will find nothing impertinent in the Conduct. <hi>Irenaeus, Tertullian,</hi> and the reſt of the Defenders of thoſe Writings, did not object to the Enemies of the Chriſtian Religion, their private Spirit, which perſwaded them of the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Holy Scripture, but very ſubſtantial Reaſons, void of all ſuch Fanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm. Tho they were ſufficiently perſwaded of the Divinity of the Holy Scripture,
<pb facs="tcp:96711:4"/>they never objected to the Adverſaries, that it had impreſt upon it ſuch lively Characters of its Original, that it was a very difficult matter not to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg it, when read with a Spirit of Submiſſion and Humility. Their Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries being Philoſophers who conſulted their natural Reaſon, they oppoſed them from ſure and indiſputable Principles.</p>
                  <p>Again, I thought in a Work of this nature not convenient to ſuppreſs the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Objections of the Jews againſt the Books of the New Teſtament: For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this miſerable Nation is an Object of the contempt of the whole World, yet has there appeared among them Men of great Addreſs and Subtilty in the Diſputes againſt the Chriſtians, which I have often found true in my own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, when I have endeavoured to convince them by their own Principles. Since their Plea for Preſcription is better, and their Pretenſions are that the Diſciples of <hi>Jeſus the Son of Mary,</hi> had no reaſon to change their Religion which was delivered them by the Fathers. It is but neceſſary to examin what they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject againſt the Writings of the Evangeliſts and Apoſtles.</p>
                  <p>In this Critical Hiſtory I have treated divers other important Queſtions: And where I deviate from the Methods of the Divines of the School, it is becauſe I have found a more ſecure way. I have employed all my ſtrength to avoid the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing any thing that is not grounded on authentic Records, inſtead of which the School-Divinity teaches us, to doubt of the moſt certain. Our Religion conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing principally in Matters of Fact, the Subtilties of Divines, who are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with Antiquity, can never diſcover certainty of ſuch matters of Fact: They rather ſerve to confound the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, and form pernicious Difficulties againſt the Myſteries of our Religion.</p>
                  <p>Let it not ſeem ſtrange to any Perſon, that I recede from the Opinions which are generally received in the Schools, and prefer to the Sentiments of whole <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities the new Opinions of ſome modern Divines, which can hardly be taxed as novel, when they are found conformable to the Ancient Doctors of the Church. This I ſpeak in reference to that Paſſage, where I handle the Diſpute which was formerly between the Divines of <hi>Louvain</hi> and <hi>Doway,</hi> and the Jeſuits of that Country, concerning the inſpiration of the ſacred Books. The Doctors of both Faculties cenſured the Propoſitions of the Jeſuites of <hi>Louvain</hi> in a manner very injurious to the whole Society. But after a due examination of the Reaſons on which their grave Gentlemen founded their Cenſure, I could hardly believe their Authority alone a ſufficient Rule to oblige me to aſſent.</p>
                  <p>I propoſe Truth alone to my ſelf in this Work, without any Deference to any Maſter in particular. A true Chriſtian who profeſſes to believe the Catholick Faith, ought not to ſtile himſelf a Diſciple of S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> S. <hi>Jerome,</hi> or any other particular Father, ſince his Faith is founded on the word of Jeſus Chriſt contained in the Writings of the Apoſtles, and conſtant Tradition of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Churches. I wiſh to God the Divines of the Age were all of that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, we then ſhould not have ſeen ſo many uſeleſs Diſputes, which only prove the cauſes of Diſorders in Church and State. I have no private Intereſt which obliges me to any Party, the very name of Party is odious to me; I ſolemnly proteſt, I have no other intentions in compoſing this Work, than the benefit of the Church, and the establiſhing the moſt ſacred and divine thing in the World.</p>
                  <p>It is uſeleſs to repeat here what we ſaid in another place concerning the word <hi>Critick,</hi> which is a term of Art, which in ſome ſenſe is beſtowed on all Works whoſe deſigns are to examin the various readings, and eſtabliſh the true. The
<pb facs="tcp:96711:4"/>aim of thoſe which practiſe that Art, it not to deſtroy, but eſtabliſh. As the Holy Books are not exempt from faults, which either by the tract of Time, or negligence of the Tranſcribers have ſlipt into 'em; ſome Learned Perſons in all Ages have taken care to render them correct. The moſt barbarous Ages have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced Books, which they call, <hi>Correctoria Bibliae,</hi> or Corrections of the Bible. The Emperor <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> ſpared nothing to procure for the Oriental Churches correct Copies of all the Bibles. <hi>Charlemagne</hi> and his Succeſſors have done the ſame for the Latine Bibles of the VVeſtern Churches.</p>
                  <p>Beſides thoſe which were formerly imployed in the Monaſteries about Tranſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing of Books: There were ſome Criticks who reviewed and corrected them. This is the Reaſon why in ſome Manuſcript ancient Bibles, there are ſome Corrections found of equal Antiquity with the Books themſelves. But without aſcending ſo far to have a Precedent for the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Critical Reflections on the Sacred Books, we need only conſider the Tranſactions of the Latter Age, relating to the Latine Editions of our Bibles: VVhat prodigious pains was <hi>Robert Stephens</hi> at, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Relation of <hi>Hentenius</hi> a Divine of <hi>Louvain,</hi> to give us an exact and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Edition of the Bible? This Divine which laboured after <hi>Stephens</hi> in the ſame matter, admires the diligence and exceſſive expence of that Printer, to whom he ingeniouſly acknowledges himſelf indebted.<note n="‖" place="margin">Joann.

                  <p>It is a Vanity in the admirers of the Hebrew Text of the <hi>Jews,</hi> to beſtow ſuch great praiſes on the Maſſoreth, a good part of which conſiſts in Trifles or ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Obſervations.

There are none but Proteſtants of ill minds, ſuch as <hi>Thomas James,</hi> Author of the <hi>Bellum Papale,</hi> who cavil at the differences of the Editions of the Bible publiſhed by thoſe two Popes. There may indeed be a more perfect work, but that ought to be reſerved for particular Notes, which no ways diminiſh the Authority of thoſe Books received into publick <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</p>
                  <p>I muſt only add two words concerning thoſe Acts which are made uſe of in this Work. For the Manuſcripts, I mark the Libraries where they are found, I have cited none without reading them; the Extracts being all done by my ſelf, except that of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> which contains the four Goſpels, and the Acts of the Apostles. I had procured out of <hi>England</hi> a faithful Copy of this laſt Manuſcript in what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to the Greek, which I have exactly followed.</p>
                  <p>As for the Printed Books, of which there are numerous Quotations, for the moſt part I have contented my ſelf to relate the Paſſages in ſhort following the ſenſe only, in the Body of the work.

                     <p>JEſus Chriſt having profeſs'd that he came not into the World to deſtroy the Old Law, but rather to accompliſh it,<note place="margin">Matt. v. 17.</note> it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to him neceſſary to publiſh his Doctrine in Writing. He was content to prove his Miſſion by his Miracles, and to ſupport his Reformation upon the Books of the Old Teſtament which were received by all the Jews, to whom the Meſſias had been promiſed. So that we do not find him to have given order
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:96711:6"/>to his Diſciples to putany thing into Writing. He only commands them to Preach his Goſpel to all the Nations of the Earth; <hi>Go ye,</hi> ſays he to them,<note place="margin">Mar. xvi. 15.</note> 
                        <hi>into all the world, and preach the Goſpel.</hi> The Books of the New Teſtament took their Original from this preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. This it was that cauſed <hi>Tertullian</hi> to ſay,<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Conſtituimus in primis Evangelicum inſtrumentum Apoſtolos autores habere, quibus hoc munus Evangelii promulgandi ab ipſo Domino ſit impoſitum. <hi>Tertul.</hi> l. <hi>4.</hi> adv. <hi>Marcion.</hi> c. <hi>2.</hi>
                        </note> That the Apoſtles, to whom Jeſus Chriſt had given this Command to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulge the Goſpel, were the Authors thereof. Upon the whole matter, the Goſpels had not been put in Writing but at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of thoſe People who were willing to preſerve the memory of that which the Apoſtles had preached to them. S. <hi>Paul</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the greater part of his Epiſtles for the Inſtruction of Churches which were already erected. That Hiſtory which we call the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles</hi> was publiſhed to no other end but to ſhew to the Faithful the Progreſs of the Chriſtian Religion upon its firſt advance into the World: and the Chriſtians not having at that time any State ſeparate from that of the Jews, and being preſent and aſſiſting at all their Ceremonies in the Temple and in the Synagogues, they had no Perſons appointed to record any thing of importance which paſs'd among them. And this is the reaſon that we find not here, as in the Old Teſtament, any pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Writers who had the Charge of collecting the Acts of their State. This, during the Primitive times of Chriſtianity, gave a pretence to ſeveral Hereticks to doubt of the truth of thoſe Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical Books which to them ſeem'd to want ſome publick At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation.

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:96711:8"/>therein, and ſhall be remarked in the Sequel of this Work, are not of ſo great moment, as that we may ſay with <hi>Celſus,</hi> that the Chriſtians have changed their Goſpels, to the end that they might ſuit them to their own opinions. This cannot be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood but of the ancient Hereticks, who having no certain Rules for their Belief, reformed them according to their capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious humor. This is that for which the Orthodox Chriſtians heretofore cenſured the <hi>Theodoſians,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Euſeb. l. <hi>5.</hi> Hiſt. Eccl. c. <hi>28.</hi>
                        </note> who corrupted the Sacred Books under a pretence of correcting them; and whereas ſeveral among them had taken this liberty, all their Copies differed one from another: there were of them under the Names of <hi>Aſcle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piades, Theodoſius, Hermophilus</hi> and <hi>Apollonius,</hi> that did not in the leaſt agree together.</p>
                     <p>I will ſay nothing here concerning the Goſpel of the <hi>Marcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites</hi> whereof <hi>Origen</hi> makes mention, becauſe I deſign to treat of it in another place: I ſhall only add, that if we compare the Goſpels and the other Books of the New Teſtament with the Liturgies that we have under the Names of ſeveral Apoſtles, to whom the moſt part of the Eaſtern Chriſtians do attribute them, we ſhall be convinced that the Goſpels are truly of the Apoſtles. For all the Churches have preſerved them in their ancient Purity; whereas every particular Nation hath added to their Liturgies, and hath taken the liberty often to reviſe them. The reſpect that hath been always had to the Writings of the New Teſtament, without inſerting any conſiderable Additions therein, is an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent proof, that all People have looked upon them as Divine Books, which it is not lawful for any to alter. On the contrary they have been perſuaded, that the Liturgies, altho they bear the Names of the Apoſtles, or of ſome Diſciples of Jeſus Chriſt, were not originally written by them to whom they were attributed. And therefore it hath been left free to the Churches to add to them, or to diminiſh from them, according as occaſion requires.</p>

                     <p>He obſerves further, and more cloſe to the purpoſe; that if it were only diſputed concerning the variety of Copies, ſince they are but few in number, it would be ſufficient to conſult the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of different Countries; and if they did not agree in this point, the greater number ſhould be preferred before the leſſer, or the more ancient before the later: <hi>Plures paucioribus, aut vetuſtiores recentioribus praeferrentur.</hi> But the <hi>Manicheans,</hi> who judged not of the Truth of theſe Books but with relation to their own Ideas, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to ſubmit to this Authority, they conſulted only their reaſon in matters of Fact, wherein all Deference ought to be given to Authority; therefore when any paſſage was urged to them that thwarted their Opinion, they boldly affirmed that that part had been corrupted, or that the Book wherein it was found had been compoſed by ſome Impoſtor under the name of the Apoſtles. <hi>Fauſtus,</hi> for example, who avouched, that after having diligently peruſed the Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> he could not find therein any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy that had any regard to Jeſus Chriſt, takes this method in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering the Texts of the New Teſtament.

Theſe Hiſtories, and theſe other Acts whereof <hi>Socinus</hi> makes mention, are taken from the Churches, or from Eccleſiaſtical Writers; and this is that which compoſeth Tradition. He ought to agree to it himſelf, ſince he avoucheth in his <hi>Treatiſe of the Authority of the Holy Scriptures,</hi> that ſince the times of the Apoſtles to thoſe of <hi>Euſebius,</hi> none have doubted in the Church, that the Books of the New Teſtament were not compoſed by thoſe, whoſe Names they bear.

That which hath deceived <hi>Socinus</hi> and the other Sectaries, is a falſe notion that they have conceived of the Authority of the Church; they imagine that ſhe Judges by her own Authority only, and not upon good Acts and Records, that the Books that compoſe the Old and New Teſtament are Divine and Canonical.</p>

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:96711:11"/>Name to the five Books of the Law that he hath wrote: thoſe alſo that have collected the Acts after him, have not ſet their Names at the beginning of their Hiſtories. The ſame may be ſaid of the Evangeliſts <hi>Matthew, Mark, Luke</hi> and <hi>John.</hi> As for S. <hi>Paul,</hi> he hath always ſet his Name at the beginning of his Epiſtles, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that which is directed to the <hi>Hebrews:</hi> and the Reaſon that S. <hi>John Chryſoſtom</hi> produceth is, becauſe the former wrote for the uſe of Perſons that were preſent; whereas S. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote Letters to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that were at a diſtance. If we ſhould refer our ſelves herein to the Teſtimony of this Father, we cannot prove preciſely from the Titles only that are at the Head of every Goſpel, that theſe Goſpels have been compoſed by thoſe whoſe Names they bear, at leaſt if we do not joyn to this, the Authority of the Primitive Church, that hath added theſe Titles. On this Principle it is that <hi>Tannerus</hi> and other Jeſuits ſupported themſelves in a Conference that they had at <hi>Ratisbonne</hi> with ſome Proteſtants, to ſhew that they could not clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prove the Title of S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> and without the Teſtimony of the ancient Eccleſiaſtical Writers, that this Goſpel was made by him whoſe name it bore: they inſiſted that they could not bring other Proofs of this Truth than thoſe that were taken from humane Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and not from the Scriptures themſelves, ſince they had been added to them: <hi>Ex ſolo teſtimonio hominum, eorumque non omnium, ſed eorum tantum qui Eccleſiae corpus conſtituunt,</hi>

                        </note> A Proteſtant Divine who had aſſiſted at this Conference, hath compoſed a Book on purpoſe on this Subject, to prove the contrary to that which the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits maintained. But to ſay the truth, there is more of Subtilty in theſe ſorts of Diſputes than of ſolid Arguments: for although it were true that S. <hi>Matthew</hi> is the Author of the Title of his Goſpel, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe muſt always be had to the Authority of the ancient Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Writers, to ſhew that this Title is of him, and that this Goſpel certainly belongs to him whoſe Name it bears; at leaſt if we decline flying to a private Spirit, which hath been above diſcourſed, and cannot be approved by any judicious Perſons.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Titles are ſo ancient in the Church, that <hi>Tertullian</hi> reproves <hi>Marcion,</hi> who acknowledged the Goſpel of St. <hi>Luke,</hi> from which he had only took away ſome Paſſages,<note n="(b)" place="bottom">Marcion Evangelio ſcilicet ſuo nullum adſcribit auctorem: quaſi non licuerit illi titulum quoque adfingere, cui nefas non fuit ipſum corpus evertere. <hi>Tertull. lib. 4. adv.

It is not to be inferred that <hi>Tertullian</hi> was of Opinion that it might be proved by the Titles only, that the Goſpels belonged to thoſe whoſe Names they bore; otherwiſe he ought to have acknowledged as the true Goſpels, an infinite number of falſe Books that carried the Names of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles: It was neceſſary, according to his mind, to have beſides this, a conſtant Tradition founded on the Teſtimonies of thoſe who had lived before; therefore he adds at the ſame time, that<note n="(d)" place="bottom">Si ſub ipſius Pauli nomine Evangelium Marcion intuliſſet, non ſufficeret ad fidem ſingularitas inſtrumenti deſtituta patrocinio anteceſſorum. <hi>Tertull. ibid.</hi>

                     <p>He goes yet farther in declaring that he did not take advantage of the Title that is at the beginning of S. <hi>Luke</hi> in the Copies of the Church,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note>

                     <p>Laſtly, <hi>Tertullian</hi> concludes, That there was no other true Copy of S. <hi>Luke</hi> but his, becauſe it was before that which <hi>Marcion</hi> had corrected; and the Reaſon that he alledgeth is this, That he could not amend any but that which was in the Church, and was conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently antecedent to his. <hi>Id emendans quod invenit, &amp; id poſterius quod de noſtro, emendatione conſtituens ſuum &amp; novum fecit.</hi> But ſince it might be objected to him, that it is not always true, that the moſt ancient Books are the moſt correct, becauſe they alſo may have been corrupted, at leaſt if they be not the true Originals: he anſwers, that it is neceſſary to look back to the time of the Apoſtles, to be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that we have their genuine Writings.<note n="(f)" place="bottom">In ſumma ſi conſtat id verius quod prius, id prius quod &amp; ab initio, ab initio quod ab Apoſtolis; pariter utique conſtabit, id eſſe ab Apoſtolis traditum, quod apud Eccleſias Apoſtolorum fuerit ſacroſanctum. <hi>Tertull. ibid. cap. 5.</hi>
                        </note> Now we are aſſured (according to his Opinion) that a thing belongs to the times of the Apoſtles, when we ſee that it hath been inviolably preſerved in the Apoſtolical Churches.</p>
                     <p>All theſe Arguments of <hi>Tertullian</hi> prove, that the conſtant Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Church is the mark by which we diſtinguiſh the Divine and Canonical Books from thoſe that are not ſo; and that it is this ſame Church that hath added, or at leaſt approved of the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of the four Goſpels, to denote to us, that theſe Goſpels were written by Apoſtles, or by their Diſciples; which does not in the leaſt agree with this private Spirit of ſome Proteſtants.

                     <p>IT hath been obſerved above, that Jeſus Chriſt never publiſhed any Work to make known his Doctrine, and that he did not ſo much as give order to his Diſciples to write that which he had taught them, but only to preach it to all the Nations of the Earth: never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, there have been found Impoſtors who have ſet forth Books under his Name, and have attributed to him certain Acts written in form of Letters, the forgery whereof diſcovers it ſelf, in regard they are directed to <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul.</hi> They have not minded, when they compoſed theſe Letters, that <hi>Paul</hi> was not the Diſciple of Jeſus Chriſt till after the Death of the ſame Jeſus Chriſt.<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Quomodo potuit libros quos, antequam moreretur, eum ſcripſiſſe putari vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunt, ad diſcipulos tanquam familiariſſimos Petrum &amp; Paulum ſcribere, cùm Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus nondum fuerit diſcipulus ejus? <hi>Auguſt. de Conſen.

                        </note> How then could it be (ſaith St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi>) that he ſhould write to <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> as to his dear Diſciples with whom he converſed famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly, ſince this latter was not then in the number of his Diſciples? Beſides, theſe Books were full of Secrets, or rather Superſtitions, of the Art that is called Magick; which in no wiſe agrees with Jeſus Chriſt, who hath always profeſſed, and the Chriſtians after him, to condemn this kind of Superſtition. It is probable, that whereas his extraordinary Actions were famous throughout the World, and his Miracles ſurprizing, they took occaſion from thence to feign this Work to diſperſe abroad I know not what magical Secrets, which they pretended he had put in practice: indeed the <hi>Jews,</hi> who were his Enemies, not being able to deny the truth of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:96711:15"/>gave it out every where that he was a Magician. They have not been aſhamed alſo to ſet down theſe Fables in their <hi>Talmud,</hi> and to ſay that Jeſus had learned in <hi>Egypt</hi> the moſt ſubtil Myſteries of Magick.<note place="margin">Apud Origen, lib. <hi>1.</hi> cont.

                        <hi>Celſus</hi> reproaches the ancient Chriſtians almoſt after the ſame manner, under the Perſon of a <hi>Jew</hi> whom he introduces to ſpeak.

                     <p>The Letter of Jeſus Chriſt to <hi>Agbar</hi> King of <hi>Edeſſa,</hi> ſeems not to be ſo far from Truth, becauſe <hi>Euſebius</hi> that produceth it with the Letter of this Prince to Jeſus, aſſures us, that he hath taken theſe two pieces from the <hi>Archives</hi> of <hi>Edeſſa,</hi> that contained the Records of what hath paſſed under the Reign of <hi>Agbar,</hi> and that they were ſtill kept in his time written in <hi>Syriack,</hi> which was the Language of the Country; from whence they were tranſlated into <hi>Greek.</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs Pope <hi>Gelaſius</hi> had reaſon to reject this Letter of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour to <hi>Agbar</hi> as Apocryphal:<note place="margin">Gelaſ. decr. <hi>1.</hi> par. diſt. <hi>15.</hi> c. <hi>3.</hi>

We ought then to take it for a certain Maxim, that Jeſus Chriſt hath written nothing, and that we have nothing of his but what we have received from his Apoſtles.

S. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> propounds to them the example of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> and <hi>Socrates,</hi> two of the greateſt Men of the Pagan Antiquity, who have written nothing of their own Actions, no more than Jeſus Chriſt, and yet they do not for this reaſon decline referring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to their Diſciples herein.

                     <p>WE may conclude from all that hath been above related, that the moſt ancient Fathers of the Church, when they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to eſtabliſh the truth of the Books of the New Teſtament, have not had recourſe to any Originals that had been kept in the Apoſtolical Churches, but only to true and exact Copies of them, which being found the ſame in all theſe Churches, were in the place of the Originals themſelves.

                     <p>As for what relates to the Primitive Hereticks, they would not have been more ſolidly confuted by oppoſing to them the Originals of the Writings of the Apoſtles, ſince they took the liberty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their Doctrine, and to ſet up in oppoſition to their Books I know not what Traditions, of which they themſelves were the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors; as may be ſeen more at large in the Books of S. <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> who underſtood perfectly well the Opinions of theſe ancient Sectaries, of which he hath left us ſome Records.

                     <p>Although the Scriptures are a ſure Rule on which our Faith is founded, yet this Rule is not altogether ſufficient of it ſelf; it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to know, beſides this, what are the Apoſtolical Traditions; and we cannot learn them but from the Apoſtolical Churches, who have preſerved the true Senſe of Scriptures.

There was no talk in thoſe days of reading the Holy Scriptures in the Originals; any Copy whatſoever, provided it were uſed in the Orthodox Churches, might be relied on, as if it had been the firſt Original written with the hand of the Apoſtles. We ought to give the ſame credit to Copies that have been made of the Apoſtolical Writings, as to the very Originals, becauſe theſe Copies have been taken from thence even from the times of the Apoſtles, and have been afterwards diſperſed almoſt throughout the whole Earth: they have been preſerved in all the Churches of the World, having been tranſlated into divers Languages; inſomuch, that there is no Book the Copies whereof are more authentick than thoſe of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament: and in this we ought chiefly to acknowledge the peculiar Providence of God in the preſervation of theſe Books that he hath given to his Church by the Miniſtry of the Apoſtles, or of their Diſciples.</p>

This is eaſie to be proved from the Septuagint, and other ancient <hi>Greek</hi> Interpreters of the Bible. <hi>Grotius,</hi> who hath alſo made this Objection in his Notes on S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> anſwers<note n="(f)" place="bottom">Solenne eſt omnibus ſcriptoribus, etiam interpretibus, vocabula peregrina notabiliora ſervare integra, ſed addito interpretamento.

                     <p>S. <hi>Jerom</hi> himſelf anſwers to the firſt Reaſon, when he ſaith<note n="(g)" place="bottom">Vocatur à pleriſque Matthaei authenticum. <hi>Hieron. Comm. in Cap. 12. Matth.</hi>
                        </note> that the moſt part of the ancient Doctors of the Church have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that this <hi>Hebrew</hi> Goſpel was the Original of S. <hi>Matthew</hi>'s. Certainly it is the very ſame that this Apoſtle wrote for the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Chriſtians of <hi>Judaea,</hi> who then ſpake the <hi>Chaldaick</hi> Language.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Eraſmus</hi> tells us, that he never heard of this matter, when he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects that the Goſpel of the <hi>Nazarenes</hi> was not in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> but in <hi>Chaldaick</hi> or <hi>Syriack,</hi> not knowing that this <hi>Chaldaick</hi> or <hi>Syriack</hi> was
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:96711:28"/>then called <hi>Hebrew.</hi> As for the Style this Reaſon is too general to be able to conclude any thing from thence. <hi>Stunica</hi> hath very well anſwered,<note n="(h)" place="bottom">Non hoc mirum videri debet, ſi loquendi idiomate omnes conveniant, etiamſi diverſis linguis Evangelia conſcripſerint: erant enim ejuſdem generis, hoc eſt He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braei ex Herbaeis; &amp; qui Graecè ex illis ſcripſerunt, patriae linguae proprietatem in Craecâ ſcripturâ ſaepiſſimè referunt. <hi>Jacob.

                        </note> that it is not to be admired that the ſtyle of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel; appears to be the ſame in all the Evangeliſts, altho they had written in different Languages, becauſe that being <hi>Jews,</hi> thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them that have written in <hi>Greek</hi> have very often kept the <hi>Genius</hi> and propriety of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue. This he proves by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of S. <hi>Luke,</hi> who, tho he hath compoſed his Goſpel and the Acts of the Apoſtles in more elegant <hi>Greek</hi> than that of the other Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts, doth not forbear to make uſe of divers Expreſſions that are purely <hi>Hebrew.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The third Objection is taken from <hi>Calvin,</hi> and is grounded on ſeveral Paſſages of the Old Teſtament, cited by S. <hi>Matthew</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Greek</hi> Verſion of the <hi>Septuagint.</hi> Whence he infers, that S. <hi>Matthew</hi> hath compoſed his Goſpel in <hi>Greek:</hi> otherwiſe writing for the uſe of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> who read the Bible in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> he would have rehearſed theſe Paſſages after the ſame manner as they are in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text. But this reaſon is deſtructive of it ſelf, becauſe he that hath tranſlated the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Goſpel of <hi>S. Matthew</hi> into <hi>Greek,</hi> performing it for perſons that ſpake <hi>Greek,</hi> and read the Bible in this Language, ought to quote the Authorities of the Old Teſtament, rather according to the <hi>Greek</hi> Verſion of the Septuagint, than according to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text which they underſtood not.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Illyricus</hi> adds to all theſe Reaſons, that there is no likelyhood that S. <hi>Matthew</hi> ſhould deſign to write his Goſpel in a Language that was no longer in uſe, becauſe at that time all People, and even the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves ſpake <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Chaldaick:</hi> Beſides that the Holy Ghoſt, who was the Author of theſe Books, knew that the Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was not far off. Therefore there is no appearance (ſaith he) that he ſhould intend to publiſh the Goſpel in any other Language but the <hi>Greek,</hi> which was the Language of the Empire.</p>
                     <p>This Proteſtant is groſly miſtaken, when he believes after <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> that it is ſuppoſed that the Goſpel of S. <hi>Matthew</hi> hath been written in the ancient <hi>Hebrew;</hi> whereas the <hi>Hebrew</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> at that time was the <hi>Chaldaick</hi> Language which they had brought with them from <hi>Babylon,</hi> and had only a little altered it. It hath indeed been
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:96711:28"/>more convenient that the Books of the New Teſtament ſhould be written rather in <hi>Greek</hi> than in another Language. But here it is only argued concerning the <hi>Jews</hi> of <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> to whom S. <hi>Matthew</hi> firſt preached the Goſpel. And ſince thoſe People ſpake <hi>Chaldaick,</hi> it was neceſſary for him to preach to them in this ſame Language. On theſe grounds all Antiquity hath relied, when they have believed that S. <hi>Matthew</hi> had compoſed his Goſpel in <hi>Hebrew.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He oppoſeth moreover, that S. <hi>Macthew</hi> ſaw that the <hi>Jews</hi> did daily harden their Hearts, and that they had an Abhorrence of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of Jeſus Chriſt. And therefore it is not credible (ſaith <hi>Illyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi>) that this holy Apoſtle hath written his Goſpel for their ſake, and in their Language. But to what purpoſe are reaſons drawn from expediency againſt matters of fact that are evident? We cannot doubt but many <hi>Jews</hi> of <hi>Paleſtine</hi> have received the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt by the Miniſtry of S. <hi>Matthew;</hi> and whereas they ſpake <hi>Chaldaick</hi> or <hi>Syriack,</hi> he could not leave this Goſpel with them in Writing, but in the Language that was ſpoken by them. On this account we may judge of other the like reaſons alledged by <hi>Illyricus</hi> to the ſame purpoſe. He pretends, for example, that Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence would never have permitted the loſs of ſo great a Treaſure, if it were certain that the Goſpel of S. <hi>Matthew</hi> had been written in <hi>Hebrew.</hi> He adds farther, that if S. <hi>Hierom</hi> had been truly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded that the <hi>Hebrew</hi> was the Original of this Goſpel, he would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have tranſlated it than the <hi>Greek;</hi> now it cannot be ſaid that he hath tranſlated it from the <hi>Hebrew</hi> into <hi>Greek.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is in vain that this Proteſtant calls the Providence of God to his aſſiſtance, in oppoſition to a fact that cannot be reaſonably doubted of. The Fathers and the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves make no difficulty to acknowledge, that ſome Sacred Books have been loſt: which never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs cannot be ſaid of the Goſpel of S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> ſince we have it in <hi>Greek</hi> in a ſtate ſufficiently perfect. The reaſon why the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> or <hi>Chaldaick</hi> Copy is not preſerved, is becauſe the Churches of <hi>Judaea,</hi> for whoſe uſe it was primarily written, have not long ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted: On the contrary the Churches wherein the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed have always endured, and it is through the means of theſe laſt Churches that we have yet to this day the <hi>Greek</hi> Copy of S. <hi>Matthew.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This may ſerve alſo for an Anſwer to the Objection of <hi>Chamierus,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Chamier. Panſtrat. lib. <hi>11</hi> c. <hi>8.</hi> n. <hi>8.</hi>
                        </note> who could not imagine how it could come to paſs that there ſhould have been ſo great a negligence in the Church in general, and in particular in that of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Goſpel of S. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> hath been loſt from the firſt Ages of Chriſtianity. Nevertheleſs it is very eaſie to be apprehended, if we conſider that the Writings of the Apoſtles that were read in the Churches were preſerved by the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:96711:29"/>means of the ſame: it is not therefore an extraordinary thing to ſee that the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Goſpel of S. <hi>Matthew</hi> hath been loſt in the loſs of the Churches of the <hi>Nazarenes.</hi> It is in the mean time worth the obſerving, that it periſhed not entirely from the primitive times of Chriſtianity; for the Sect of the <hi>Nazarenes</hi> who took their original from the firſt <hi>Nazarenes</hi> or Chriſtians of <hi>Judaea,</hi> continued for a long time to read it in their Aſſemblies. It paſſed alſo to the <hi>Ebionites,</hi> who altered it in ſome places: notwithſtanding theſe Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations, it might always be ſaid, that this was the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Goſpel of S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> eſpecially if reſpect were had to the Copy of the <hi>Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renes,</hi> which was more pure than that of the <hi>Ebionites,</hi> and was ſtill extant in the time of S. <hi>Hierom,</hi> who tranſlated it into <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin.</hi> The other Chriſtians neglected it, becauſe beſides their not underſtanding the Language in which it was written, they conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the <hi>Nazarenes</hi> as a ſort of half Chriſtians that ſtill kept the Ceremonies of the Law; and they rejected the <hi>Ebionites</hi> as Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Illyricus</hi> adds farther to all theſe Objections, that S. <hi>Matthew</hi> being a Publican, was either half a <hi>Grecian</hi> or a <hi>Roman;</hi> and that for this reaſon he ought rather to apply himſelf to write his Goſpel in <hi>Greek</hi> for thoſe of his Nation, than in <hi>Hebrew</hi> for the <hi>Jews.</hi> If this way of reaſoning concluded any thing, it might be inferred from thence at the ſame time, that S. <hi>John</hi> who was an <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and whoſe Mother-Tongue was <hi>Syriack</hi> or <hi>Chaldaick</hi> ſhould have compoſed his Goſpel in this Language for thoſe of his own Nations. It availeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to oppoſe ſimple reaſons of conveniency to manifeſt and clear matters of Fact. Neither is there any weight in a proof that he brings in the ſame place from certain <hi>Latin</hi> Words that are found in the Goſpel of S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> which are more agreeable (as he thinks) to a <hi>Greek</hi> Author, than to a Man that writes in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Grecians</hi> had more Intercourſe with the <hi>Latins,</hi> than the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> But may it not be ſaid that theſe <hi>Latin</hi> Words do rather belong to the <hi>Greek</hi> Tranſlation, than to the original <hi>Hebrew?</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the Jews of thoſe times who were under ſubjection to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> might have adopted divers <hi>Latin</hi> Words into their Language. This ſame Principle may ſerve to reſolve another Objection that he raiſeth from the word <hi>Petrus</hi> which is in S. <hi>Matthew.</hi> If this Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle (ſaith <hi>Illyricus</hi>) had written in <hi>Hebrew</hi> or <hi>Syriack,</hi> he would have made uſe of the Word <hi>Cephas,</hi> and not of that of <hi>Petrus:</hi> as if it might not be ſaid that it is the <hi>Greeks</hi> Interpreter that hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted the Word <hi>Petrus.</hi> Laſtly, he objects, that S. <hi>Matthew</hi> epito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mizeth with too much liberty in <hi>Chap.</hi> xii. of his Goſpel, a Paſſage of <hi>Chap.</hi> 47. of <hi>Iſaiah:</hi> Which he would not have done (ſaith he) if
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:96711:29"/>he had written in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> becauſe he would have produced the very Words of the Text. And it is not credible (adds he) that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter ſhould be the Author of this Abbreviation. All this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation that is grounded on no poſitive proof is nothing to the purpoſe. The Apoſtles on the contrary do often cite the Paſſages of the Old Teſtament only according to the ſenſe, and they rehearſe them ſometimes in ſhort, only producing that which relates to their deſign.<note place="margin">J.

He adds farther, that the <hi>Jews</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> could not learn the <hi>Chaldaick</hi> but of the <hi>Jews</hi> that were on the other ſide of the River <hi>Euphrates:</hi> that it is madneſs to ſay that the ſaid <hi>Jews</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> have kept this Language by Tradition in a place where the <hi>Greek</hi> hath been in uſe for many Ages; eſpecially it being impoſſible to bring any Example that may make it appear that a Language can be preſerved in a Country, when another hath obtained therein. He concludes at laſt, that the <hi>Jews</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> had no other vulgar Tongue in the time of our Saviour and the Apoſtles than the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin;</hi> and that thoſe who had ſome knowledge of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> or <hi>Chaldaick,</hi> had attained it after the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:96711:31"/>ſame manner as we now learn the <hi>Latin</hi> at this day, or by the Commerce that they had with the <hi>Jews</hi> that were on the farther ſide of <hi>Euphrates,</hi> where the <hi>Chaldaick</hi> was ſpoken.</p>
                     <p>Here it would be requiſite to follow Mr. <hi>Voſſius</hi> ſtep by ſtep, who hath had no other deſign in all this long Diſcourſe, than to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found and intricate the matter in hand, not being able to anſwer preciſely to the Reaſons that have been propoſed to him. It may be obſerved in the firſt place, that the preſent Queſtion is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ancient Fathers that have ſpoken <hi>Syriack,</hi> and have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Books in this ſame Language; but only relating to the <hi>Jews;</hi> and therefore the Examples that he produceth of St. <hi>Ephraem</hi> and ſome other Doctors of the Church, are nothing to the purpoſe; for we agree with him, that thoſe that have inhabited the Country that is on the farther ſide of <hi>Euphrates,</hi> have ſpoken <hi>Syriack:</hi> it is agreed alſo, that the <hi>Jews</hi> of the <hi>Parthian</hi> or <hi>Arabian</hi> Nation, who depended not on the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, ſpake the <hi>Chaldaick</hi> or <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loniſh</hi> Language. And not to inſiſt on Queſtions about names, we are willing alſo to call that Tongue <hi>Chaldaick</hi> rather than <hi>Syriack,</hi> which is called <hi>Hebrew</hi> in the New Teſtament, though the ancient Fathers have named it <hi>Syriack,</hi> and though it be properly neither <hi>Chaldaick</hi> nor <hi>Syriack,</hi> it being degenerated from the true <hi>Chaldaick.</hi> All that Mr. <hi>Voſſius</hi> can conclude from his Suppoſition, is, that the <hi>Jews</hi> who were beyond <hi>Euphrates</hi> ſpake only <hi>Chaldaick,</hi> whereas the <hi>Jews</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and of <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> at leaſt the moſt polite of them, ſpake, beſides the <hi>Chaldaick</hi> which their Fathers had brought from <hi>Babylon,</hi> the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue, which was become vulgar in theſe places.</p>
                     <p>It is madneſs to ſay that St. <hi>Paul,</hi> when he made his Oration in <hi>Hebrew</hi> or <hi>Chaldaick</hi> in the preſence of the <hi>Jews</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> had only regard to thoſe that were beyond <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and to thoſe that had learn'd the <hi>Chaldaick</hi> Tongue of them. He directs his Words in general to all the <hi>Jews</hi> that were preſent: and it cannot be ſaid that he had only Strangers for his Auditors. <hi>Joſephus</hi> was of the number of the <hi>Jews</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and not of the <hi>Parthian</hi> or <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian</hi> Nation: he declares in the mean time,<note place="margin">Joſeph.

                        <note place="margin">Joſeph. Praefat. lib. de Bell. Jud.</note> and a Prieſt; and in this ſame Paſſage he calls the <hi>Chaldaick</hi> the Language of his Country. This makes it evident that the <hi>Chaldaick</hi> cannot be reſtrained to the <hi>Jews</hi> only that were on the other ſide of <hi>Euphrates,</hi> ſince <hi>Joſephus</hi> was not of that Country. Both the one
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:96711:32"/>and the other ſort ſpake in this Tongue, with this difference only, that thoſe that dwelled in the Countries that were beyond <hi>Euphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> ſpake nothing but <hi>Chaldaick;</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the <hi>Chaldaick</hi> ſpeak the <hi>Greek</hi> Language that was diſperſed through <hi>Paleſtin.</hi>

                     <p>This is a manifeſt Proof, that the <hi>Greek</hi> was the vulgar Tongue of the Country, and that the <hi>Jews,</hi> beſides the <hi>Greek,</hi> had preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the <hi>Chaldaick</hi> which they had brought from <hi>Babylon,</hi> and which they called the Language of the Nation. The <hi>Jews</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> have alſo retained it always, tho the <hi>Greek</hi> was the vulgar Tongue of <hi>Paleſtine.</hi> This is yet more apparently ſeen in another Example that hath been already oppoſed to Mr. <hi>Voſſius,</hi> I mean the <hi>Jews</hi> of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Rite who dwell at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> and in ſome other Cities of the <hi>Levant:</hi> theſe <hi>Jews</hi> do ſtill keep their ancient <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> with the Language of the Countries which they inhabit; and they have alſo Tranſlations of the Bible in <hi>Spaniſh</hi> for their uſe.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Voſſius</hi> anſwers this Objection, that this might be in ſome manner true in the time of <hi>Mariana,</hi> becauſe when this <hi>Jeſuit</hi> wrote his Hiſtory, it was not an Age ſince the <hi>Jews</hi> had been driven out of <hi>Spain.</hi> He adds farther, that the other Hiſtorians who have written at that very time ſpeak quite otherwiſe, becauſe the <hi>Jews</hi>

This is the ground of the preſent Diſpute: and by this it is made appear, that it is not impoſſible that the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould retain their ancient Language where there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that is vulgarly ſpoken. We ſee moreover, that the <hi>Portugal Jews</hi> of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Rite, who are ſettled at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> do keep the <hi>Portugal,</hi> with the Language of the Country; and that their Rabbins do alſo preach in <hi>Portugaiſe</hi> in their Synagogue.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, it is not true that all the <hi>Jews</hi> that were driven out of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal</hi> took refuge among the <hi>Moors:</hi> there were many that withdrew themſelves into <hi>Italy,</hi> from whence ſome paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed afterwards into the <hi>Levant.</hi> However it were, it is certain that there is at this day, in the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Territories, a conſiderable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>Jews,</hi> who follow the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Rite; and beſides that of the Places where they remain, do ſpeak their ancient <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Language.

                        </note> of the Excellency of the <hi>Chaldaick</hi> or <hi>Syriack</hi> Tongue. Since this ingenious <hi>Maronite</hi> hath had a very clear notion of this matter, I ſhall produce the ſum of what he ſaith concerning theſe two Languages in his preliminary Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes.</p>
                     <p>This Tongue whereof we now treat (ſaith <hi>Amira</hi>) hath been cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Chaldaick,</hi> from <hi>Chaldaea</hi> where it hath been firſt in uſe, when the Confuſion of Languages happened; therefore it hath been alſo named <hi>Babylonian,</hi> from <hi>Babylon</hi> the Capital City of <hi>Chaldaea:</hi> it was afterwards called <hi>Aramean</hi> or <hi>Syriack,</hi> from <hi>Aram</hi> or <hi>Syria;</hi> and even <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> from <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> becauſe it hath alſo obtained in thoſe places. Divers other Names have been given to it, which have been borrowed from famous Nations and renowned Men, as that of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew,</hi> becauſe it hath been, during ſome time, ſpoken by the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews.</hi> Although there is ſome difference between the <hi>Chaldaick</hi> and the <hi>Syriack,</hi> nevertheleſs it cannot be ſaid that it is eſſential, for they agree almoſt in every thing: and this is the cauſe that in the Holy Scriptures the Words of <hi>Chaldaick</hi> and <hi>Syriack</hi> are promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuouſly uſed to ſignifie the very ſame Language: it is ſaid for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,<note place="margin">Dan. 1.4.</note> that <hi>Daniel</hi> and ſome other young <hi>Hebrews</hi> were inſtructed in the <hi>Chaldaick</hi> Tongue: and it is added in the mean time a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> ſpake to the King in <hi>Syriack,</hi>

                     <p>The ſame <hi>George Amira</hi> produceth other Paſſages of the Scriptures to ſhew that this Tongue was alſo called <hi>Aſſyrian.</hi> This he confirnis in like manner from profane Authors, who have confounded the Names of <hi>Chaldeans, Syrians</hi> and <hi>Aſſyrians.</hi> From whence he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oludes<note n="(u)" place="bottom">Quare mirum eſſe non debet, ſi lingua Chaldaica, Syriaca &amp; Aſſyriaca una eademque ſit, quandequidem &amp; nomina quae ei indita ſunt pro eodem uſurpantur. <hi>Georg.

                        </note> that they would be leſs different, if the <hi>Jews</hi> had not Printed the <hi>Chaldaick</hi> of their Books after their manner; this he proves by ſome Examples.

                     </p>
                     <p>This dextrous Man calls the <hi>Jews</hi> to his aſſiſtance,<note place="margin">Voſſ. Reſp. ad tert. P. Sim.

He adds farther, that the <hi>Jews</hi> who read in <hi>Syria</hi> the Verſion which the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> and the <hi>Arabians</hi> call <hi>Syriack,</hi> do term it <hi>Chaldaick.</hi> Laſtly, he demands who are thoſe People of <hi>Syria</hi> that have introduced into <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> this <hi>Syriack</hi>
                        <pb n="57" facs="tcp:96711:35"/>Tongue, which is pretended to have been in uſe in the time of Jeſus Chriſt and the Apoſtles.</p>
                     <p>But if he had conſulted the <hi>Talmud,</hi> or had but an indifferent knowledge in the <hi>Chaldaick</hi> Tongue, he would not have made ſuch weak Objections. It is evident that there is nothing more uſual in the Books of the <hi>Talmud</hi> than to call the <hi>Chaldaick</hi> or <hi>Babylonian</hi> Tongue <hi>Arami</hi> or <hi>Syriack.</hi> The Rabbins who have epitomized the <hi>Talmud,</hi> and have collected its Deciſions, do alſo give the name of <hi>Arami</hi> or <hi>Syriack</hi> to the <hi>Chaldaick</hi> Tongue. To convince Mr. <hi>Voſſius,</hi> even by the example that he hath produced of the Prayer that ought not to be made in the <hi>Syriack</hi> Tongue; the <hi>Talmudiſts</hi> give out this fantaſtick Story upon occaſion of the Prayer called <hi>Kadis,</hi> which is in the <hi>Chaldaick</hi> Tongue, and which nevertheleſs they call in this place <hi>Arami</hi> or <hi>Syriack.</hi> This Prayer not being ſo ancient as the others that have been compoſed in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> is written in the <hi>Chaldaick</hi> Language, which was then underſtood by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. The Rabbins who are ſo nicely ſubtil on all occaſions, and often tell Tales, inſtead of giving ſolid Reaſons, have invented this Fable which Mr. <hi>Voſſius</hi> relates very ſeriouſly. However it be, it is certain that this Prayer <hi>Kadis,</hi> which is ſuppoſed, according to the Rabbins to be written in <hi>Syriack,</hi> that is not underſtood by the Angels, is written in <hi>Chaldaick,</hi> and in the ſame Language as the Paraphraſes which we have upon the Bible.</p>
                     <p>As for the Objection, that in the <hi>Syriack</hi> Verſion of the New Teſtament, the word <hi>Aram</hi> hath been put to ſignifie a <hi>Greek,</hi> a <hi>Gentile,</hi> and an Idolater, I do not ſee that it can be proved from thence that the <hi>Jews</hi> have not confounded the Words of <hi>Syriack</hi> and <hi>Chaldaick.</hi> For beſides that experience ſhews us the contrary, this only proves that the <hi>Jews</hi> have looked upon <hi>Syria</hi> as the Country of Idolatry; they have made uſe of the word <hi>Arami</hi> in the ſame ſenſe as that of <gap reason="foreign">

                        <hi>Greek</hi> in the New Teſtament is applyed to ſignifie a <hi>Greek,</hi> a <hi>Gentile</hi> and an Idolater.</p>
                     <p>I am willing to grant that the <hi>Jews</hi> give the name of <hi>Chaldaick</hi> to the Verſions which the Chriſtians call <hi>Syriack.</hi> But what can be concluded from thence, ſince theſe ſame <hi>Jews</hi> do indifferently call that Tongue in which they are written <hi>Chaldaick</hi> or <hi>Syriack?</hi> The Chriſtians of the <hi>Syrian</hi> Nation do very often call their <hi>Syriack</hi> Tongue <hi>Chaldaick.</hi> The <hi>Syriack Miſſal</hi> which hath been Printed at <hi>Rome</hi> for the uſe of the <hi>Maronites,</hi> is intituled<note n="*" place="margin">Miſſale Chaldaic. juxta ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum Eccl. nationis Maroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarum e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit.

But tho we ſhould ſuppoſe with <hi>Caſaubon,</hi> that the <hi>Nazarenes</hi> have been Hereticks, would this hinder their <hi>Hebrew</hi> Goſpel which had been written in this Language by S. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi> from being a true Original? I would willingly know whether the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text of the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> is leſs authentick in the Hands of the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> and of the <hi>Jews</hi> called <hi>Caraites,</hi> than it is in the Hands of the other <hi>Jews</hi> who bear the name of <hi>Rabbanites,</hi> and from whom we have received it?

This Church reckons them equally in the number of Hereticks; may it be ſaid for this reaſon that the New Teſtament which is in uſe among the Proteſtants is not authentick?

And therefore the proof that <hi>Caſaubon</hi> brings from the pretended Hereſie of the <hi>Nazarenes,</hi> and from that of the <hi>Ebionites,</hi> is of no weight.</p>
                     <p>Beſides it is not true that the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Goſpel of S. <hi>Matthew</hi> hath been in uſe among the Hereticks only, ſince, as hath been above ſhewn, it hath been compoſed for the Primitive Chriſtians of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtin,</hi> from whom the <hi>Nazarene</hi> Sectaries were deſcended, and the <hi>Greek</hi> is only a Verſion of it. Neither can it be averred, that the Catholicks have not acknowledged any other Copy of S. <hi>Matthew</hi> than that which is in <hi>Greek,</hi> ſince the <hi>Jews</hi> of the Territory of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> who embraced the Chriſtian Religion, and were called <hi>Nazarenes,</hi> have been the firſt Chriſtians in the World, it would be a piece of injuſtice in us to treat them as Hereticks, for this reaſon only, becauſe they retained the Ceremonies of the Old Law with Chriſtianity: otherwiſe we muſt treat the Apoſtles as Hereticks, who obſerved them alſo at the beginning: this might be then tolerated in theſe Primitive Chriſtians who ſprang out from the middle of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and who had before their eyes the Example of Jeſus Chriſt and the Apoſtles.</p>
                     <p>That which hath miſled <hi>Caſaubon</hi> and many others, as well Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants as Catholicks, who have rejected the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Goſpel of the <hi>Nazarenes</hi> as an Apocryphal Piece, is that they have not duly reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Original of the Chriſtian Religion.

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:96711:39"/>only hath been preſerved amongſt the Catholicks, becauſe all the other Chriſtians have taken their Verſions from this Copy. The <hi>Chaldaick</hi> Tongue, in which the Goſpel of the <hi>Nazarenes</hi> was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, was not underſtood but by ſome <hi>Jews:</hi> beſides, the <hi>Nazarenes,</hi> who had retained <hi>Judaiſm</hi> with <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> became odious to the other Chriſtians who were converted from <hi>Gentiliſm,</hi> and there was an irreconcileable Hatred between them. If the ancient <hi>Nazarenes</hi> for whom S. <hi>Matthew</hi> had written his Goſpel were yet in being, their <hi>Hebrew</hi> Copy would be without doubt preferred before the <hi>Greek</hi> Verſion which we have.</p>
                     <p>S. <hi>Jerom</hi> and S. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> are ſo far from being favourable to the Judgment of <hi>Caſaubon,</hi> that on the contrary they overthrow it in expreſs terms, as appears from their Teſtimonies which we have above related.

                        </note> It is dangerous (ſaith this Cardinal) to put it in any other Claſs than that of Apocryphal Books, becauſe there can be but one Truth. If we underſtand in the mean time by <hi>Apocryphal,</hi> a falſe Book, it is not true in that ſenſe, that the Goſpel of the <hi>Nazarenes</hi> is Apocryphal; it may be only ſaid, that if there are conſiderable Additions therein that alter the ſenſe, it is no more Authentick: and this is that which is to be proved. I ſpeak only of the Copy of the <hi>Nazarenes,</hi> and not of that of the <hi>Ebionites,</hi> who had corrupted it on purpoſe to adjuſt it to their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices.</p>
                     <p>We ought not, notwithſtanding, to compare the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Goſpel of the <hi>Nazarenes,</hi>

It is not to be doubted on the contrary, that the Goſpel of the <hi>Nazarenes</hi> hath been certainly compoſed by the Apoſtle whoſe Name it bears: as for what concerns the Additions which the <hi>Nazarenes</hi> might have inſerted in the firſt Original of S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> it may happen that they are not falſe: we ought rather to attribute them to their Simplicity, and to their good Faith, than to their malice. It was the cuſtom in theſe Primitive times of Chriſtianity, to take a great deal of pains to inform themſelves of that which the Diſciples of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles had learned of their Maſters, as appears by the Example of <hi>Papias</hi> who lived in thoſe times, of S. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> who was not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and of ſome others of the Ancient. It is probable that the <hi>Nazarenes</hi> have annexed to their Goſpel of S. <hi>Matthew</hi> the like Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories which they had learned, and which they believed to be found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on good Teſtimonies: therefore they are not all to be rejected
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:96711:40"/>as falſe, though they are not to be found in any of the Copies that are uſed and allowed by the Church. It may be obſerved, that all the Churches of the World have taken their Verſions from the <hi>Greek</hi> Copy wherein theſe Additions are not expreſſed, becauſe the Goſpel of S. <hi>Matthew</hi> had been apparently tranſlated out of <hi>Hebrew</hi> into <hi>Greek</hi> before the <hi>Nazarenes</hi> had inſerted them.</p>

                        </note> It cannot be imagined (ſaith he) that the Apoſtles ſhould have preached the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt to the Nations in any other Languages but thoſe that were in uſe amongſt them.

                     <p>Theſe Reaſons on the contrary cannot but appear very weak to thoſe who are verſed in the Criticiſm of the Sacred Books.

It is no wonder that S. <hi>Mark,</hi> who is ſuppoſed to have written in <hi>Greek</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> ſhould have made uſe of <hi>Latin</hi> words Greciſed. Since it is the cuſtom of all Nations that ſpeak a foreign Language to mingle with it ſome of their own words, and ſo S. <hi>Mark</hi> would have ſpoken <hi>Greek,</hi> as it was ſpoken at <hi>Rome,</hi> and even in many other Cities of the Empire, where the <hi>Grecians</hi> had adopted divers <hi>Roman</hi> words.</p>
                     <p>If it were true that the very Original of S. <hi>Mark</hi> is at this day kept at <hi>Venice,</hi> as they of this Country do avouch, all this Diſpute

This appears manifeſtly in the Manuſcript of the King's Library.</p>
                     <p>We ought to judge after the ſame manner of this other Addition which S. <hi>Jerom</hi> declares that he hath read in ſome <hi>Greek</hi> Copies, and which he publiſheth in theſe terms. <hi>In quibuſdam exemplaribus, &amp; maxime in Graecis codicibus, juxta Marcum in fine ejus Evangelii ſic ſcribitur:</hi>

                     <p>By this ſame method we may juſtifie the Obſervation of S. <hi>Jerom</hi> in his Letter to <hi>Hedibia,</hi> wherein he declares that the laſt Chapter of S. <hi>Mark,</hi> that is to ſay, the twelve laſt Verſes were not read in the greateſt part of the <hi>Greek</hi> Copies. <hi>Beza</hi> on the contrary<note n="(k)" place="bottom">Teſtor in omnibus vetuſtis codicibus quos nobis videre contigit hoc caput inveniri. <hi>Bez.

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:96711:57"/>part of the Text. It is to be obſerved moreover, that the Sections are marked in the Margin of the <hi>Greek</hi> Manuſcripts of the New Teſtament by the Letters of the Alphabet, which ſerve inſtead of Numbers of Figures. Theſe Marks are in the firſt Editions of the <hi>Greek</hi> New Teſtament of <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> in <hi>Robert Stephen</hi>'s Edition in <hi>Folio,</hi> and in ſome others. Now there are none of theſe found in the King's Manuſcript over againſt theſe twelve Verſes, which is a proof that they were not read in their Church that have tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed this Copy.

                     <p>In the mean time, we have no certain Acts from whence we may exactly gather the time of the Publication of this Goſpel by S. <hi>Luke:</hi> we only know in general, that the ancient Eccleſiaſtical Writers do all agree that it was not written till after thoſe of S. <hi>Matthew</hi> and S. <hi>Mark.</hi> This being granted, it may be demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what reaſon he had, who was only a Diſciple of the Apoſtles, to publiſh a third Goſpel, knowing that S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> who was an Apoſtle, and a Witneſs of the moſt part of the Actions of Jeſus Chriſt, had already publiſhed one, which had been epitomized by S. <hi>Mark?</hi> Theſe two Goſpels were then in the hands of all the Chriſtians; What neceſſity was there that S. <hi>Luke</hi> ſhould make a new one, and that he ſhould give notice in his Preface, that they who had written before him on this ſame Subject were not very accurate?</p>

                     <p>It is no wonder that ſo many ancient Hereticks have publickly exploded the Writings of S. <hi>Paul;</hi> becauſe they pretended that not having ſeen Jeſus Chriſt in the fleſh, he could not call himſelf his Apoſtle.

                        </note> ſince the Church would not have given credit to S. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, who was called to the Apoſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip immediately after the Aſcenſion of our Saviour, if he had not conferred with the Apoſtles touching the Doctrine that he preached.</p>
                     <p>It is a Maxim generally received among all the ancient Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Writers, that Jeſus Chriſt alone is the Author of the Chriſtian
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:96711:78"/>Religion, and that his Apoſtles who have been the Witneſſes of his Actions and Words, have only related to us thoſe things that they had ſeen or learned from their Maſter. When it was objected to the primitive Fathers, that the Goſpels of S. <hi>Mark</hi> and S. <hi>Luke,</hi> as alſo the Epiſtles of S. <hi>Paul</hi> ought not to be received as Canonical, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Authors of theſe Writings were not Apoſtles, but only Apoſtolical Men. They have anſwered that theſe Apoſtolical Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons have written nothing but what they had received from their Maſters. They have concluded from thence, that the ſame autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ought to be given to their Writings, as if the Apoſtles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves had been the Authors of them. Therefore when <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> ſpeaks of S. <hi>Luke</hi> and S. <hi>Mark,</hi> who (according to his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion) were only Apoſtolical, he adds at the ſame time, that theſe Apoſtolical Men were not<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Si &amp; Apoſtolicos, non tamen ſolos, ſed cum Apoſtolis &amp; poſt Apoſtolos, quoniam praedicatio diſcipulorum ſuſpecta fieri poſſet de gloriae ſtudio, ſi non adſiſtat illi auctoritas magiſtrorum, imò Chriſti qui magiſtros Apoſtolos fecit. <hi>Tertull. lib. 4. adv.

                        </note> alone, having written jointly with the Apoſtles, and after them; and that therefore their Doctrine could not be ſuſpected, ſince it hath been authoriſed by their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and even by Jeſus Chriſt who had conſtituted theſe Maſters. We may apply unto S. <hi>Paul</hi> that which <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith here of S. <hi>Mark</hi> and S. <hi>Luke.</hi> And this may ſerve to reſolve all the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections of the ancient Hereticks who refuſed to allow his Writings, becauſe they denied that he was truly an Apoſtle.</p>
                     <p>I have already given an account of the <hi>Manicheans,</hi> who acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged nothing of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> but what was agreeable to the Idea that they had formed of the Chriſtian Religion. Theſe Sectaries argued againſt common Senſe. For in as much as they were not able to reconcile two Paſſages of this Apoſtle, they thought it ſufficient to conclude from thence that one of the two muſt of neceſſity be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted; ſince it was not poſſible (ſaid they) that he ſhould contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict in one place what he had affirmed in another. When it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of <hi>Fauſtus</hi> whether he received the Apoſtle, <hi>Apoſtolum acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pis?</hi> He anſwered that he did. And when it was proved to him by the Writings of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> that he ought to believe that Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God derived his Original from <hi>David,</hi> according to the fleſh, he then replyed,<note n="(b)" place="bottom">Non equidem crediderim Apoſtolum Dei contraria ſibi ſcribere potuiſſe, &amp; modò hanc, modò illam de Domino noſtro habuiſſe ſententiam. <hi>Apud Aug. lib. 11. cont.

                        </note> that it is not credible that the Apoſtle of God ſhould have written things that are contrary, and overthrow
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:96711:78"/>one another: he maintained that the Epiſtles of S. <hi>Paul</hi> had been interpolated as well as the Goſpels; and to make his Subtilty more apparent in inventing new Anſwers, he adds, that this Apoſtle might be reconciled with himſelf, in ſaying that he had two Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions thereupon, and that that which was objected was his old Opinion, which he had abandoned after he had been better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed.</p>
                     <p>But let us leave theſe Hereticks who had no certain Principles, and were therefore obliged ſometimes to have recourſe to their <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raclet,</hi> which was their great Engine.

                     <p>Laſtly, to return to S. <hi>Paul,</hi> the vanity of theſe ancient Hereticks was ſo great, that S. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> was compelled to confute ſome Sectaries,<note n="(c)" place="bottom">Eos autem qui dicunt, ſolum Paulum veritatem cognoviſſe, cui per revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem manifeſtum eſt myſterium, ipſe Paulus convincat eos dicens unum &amp; ipſum Deum operatum Petro in Apoſtolatu circumciſionis, &amp; ſibi in Gentes. <hi>Iren. adv.

                     <p>SInce I have no other deſign in this Work than to treat of the Text of the New Teſtament, and to eſtabliſh as much as is poſſible the Writings of the Apoſtles, I ſhall not inſiſt in particular on the Subject of every Epiſtle of S. <hi>Paul;</hi> this is a task that belongs rather to a Commentator of the Scriptures, than to a Critical Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Text: for this reaſon I come immediately to the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> that ſeems to have been diſputed in Antiquity, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally in the Weſtern Churches, ſome of which have refuſed to read it in their publick Aſſemblies: there are alſo at this day ſome learned Criticks, that doubt whether S. <hi>Paul</hi> be the Author thereof, though they acknowledge it as Divine and Canonical.

                        </note> yet the <hi>Latins</hi> do not put it in the number of the Canonical Epiſtles: this he repeats in ſeveral other Paſſages of his Works. But whereas moſt part of the <hi>Latin</hi> Fathers before him, and even in his time, have acknowledged this Epiſtle not only to be Canonical, but alſo to be written by S. <hi>Paul;</hi> this Cardinal thinks that S. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi> was deceived in relying altogether on the Teſtimony of <hi>Cajus</hi> and <hi>Euſebius,</hi> without conſulting the cuſtom of the <hi>Latin</hi> Churches.</p>
                     <p>I confeſs that this Father in his Book of Eccleſiaſtical Writers, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his uſual method, hath only copied the Words of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius,</hi> when he ſpeaks of <hi>Cajus;</hi> but the ſame thing cannot be ſaid of the other Paſſages, where he affirms diſtinctly from <hi>Euſebius,</hi> that this Epiſtle is not generally received amongſt the <hi>Latins. Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus Apoſtolus</hi> (ſaith he in his Commentary on <hi>Iſaiah</hi>) <hi>in Epiſtola ad Hebraeos, quam Latina conſuetudo non recipit.</hi> He adds a little after,<note n="(k)" place="bottom">Pauli quoque idcirco ad Hebraeos Epiſtolae contradicitur, quòd ad Hebraeos ſcribens utatur teſtimoniis quae in Hebraeis voluminibus non habentur. <hi>Hier.

                        </note> that this Epiſtle of S. <hi>Paul</hi> was rejected, becauſe that in writing to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> he made uſe of ſuch Teſtimonies of the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures as were not found in their Copies. This evidently proves that there were ſome Churches in thoſe times in which the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> was not acknowledged as Canonical;<note place="margin">Hier. ib.</note> this can only be underſtood of the Weſtern Churches, ſince he grants that it was
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:96711:81"/>univerſally approved in all thoſe of the Eaſt. He declares moreover, in his Letter to <hi>Dardanus,</hi>

                        </note> that without having regard to the Cuſtom of his Time, he received the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> and the Apocalypſe as Canonical Books, though the <hi>Latins</hi> did not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the firſt, nor the <hi>Grecians</hi> the ſecond. He prefers in this place the Authority of the Ancients who had cited theſe two Works as Canonical, before the practice of his time. It cannot be ſaid then, with Cardinal <hi>Baronius,</hi> that S. <hi>Jerom,</hi> when he affirms that in his time the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> was not commonly received amongſt the <hi>Latins,</hi> had only reſpect to the Teſtimony of <hi>Cajus,</hi> and that he hath done nothing but tranſcribed the Words of <hi>Euſebius;</hi> for he ſpeaks plainly of the Cuſtom of his time.</p>
                     <p>But it may be objected, that S. <hi>Hilary, Optatus,</hi> S. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin,</hi> and ſome other Fathers who lived before S. <hi>Jerom,</hi> or were contemporary with him, have not doubted that this Epiſtle was not only Canonical and Divine, but they have likewiſe believed that it was S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s; how then could it come to paſs that this Father ſhould avouch that it was not acknowledged in his time amongſt the <hi>Latins?</hi> It is true, that theſe Fathers who were <hi>Latins,</hi> and ſome of whom lived at the ſame time with S. <hi>Jerom,</hi> have all aſcribed the Epiſtle directed to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> to S. <hi>Paul,</hi> which he doth alſo him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in divers Paſſages of his Works: however, I will not conclude from thence with <hi>Baronius,</hi> that this learned Man hath not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently conſidered the Practice of his Church,<note n="(m)" place="bottom">Haec igitur oùm ex Euſebio Hieronymus exſoripſerit, majorem illi quàm par erat ſidem tribuit, dùm putavit Latinos dictam Epiſtolam non recipere. <hi>Baron. ann. ch. 60. n. 52.</hi>
                        </note> and that he hath too eaſily given credit to the Teſtimony of <hi>Euſebius;</hi> but I will ſay that a difference ought to be put between the Cuſtom of Churches, and the Atteſtation of particular Writers. When S. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi> hath written that in his time the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> was not allowed among the <hi>Latins,</hi> he hath declared the Practice of many Churches of the Weſt who did not read it in their publick Aſſemblies: this doth not hinder but that the Fathers of thoſe times might eſteem it as Canonical, and alſo as S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s. It would be an eaſie matter by this means to reconcile S. <hi>Jerom</hi> with ſome other <hi>Latin</hi> Fathers.</p>
                     <pb n="147" facs="tcp:96711:81"/>
                     <p>That which confirms the diſtinction that I have now made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Cuſtom of Churches and that of private Writers, is this, that we find ſome very ancient <hi>Greek</hi> Manuſcripts of the Epiſtles of S. <hi>Paul</hi> with the old <hi>Latin</hi> Verſion annexed to them, in which the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> hath been ſeparated on purpoſe from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Epiſtles. It ſeems to me that there can be no other reaſon given of this Separation but this, that the <hi>Latins</hi> who have tranſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed theſe Copies (as I ſhall prove hereafter) did not read this Epiſtle in their Churches: furthermore, it may be obſerved, that all the ancient <hi>Latin</hi> Authors have not attributed the Epiſtle to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi> to S. <hi>Paul;</hi> for beſides that <hi>Tertullian</hi> doth not refer to it but under the name of S. <hi>Barnabas,</hi> there is no probability that it was received as Canonical in the Church of S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> ſince he never makes uſe of its Authority in all his Works. If we ſhould ſay with <hi>Baronius,</hi> that this holy Biſhop hath followed <hi>Tertullian</hi> in this, whom he read always, and called his Maſter, this would not reſolve the difficulty: I doubt not but if the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> had been publickly read at that time in his Church, as being S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s, he would have quoted it as well as the others.</p>
                     <p>As for the Reaſons that are alledged againſt this Epiſtle, they are not of that weight as to make void the Teſtimonies of ſo great a number of Authors who have attributed it to S. <hi>Paul.</hi> Firſt,<note place="margin">Hieron. Comm. in Iſ. l. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>6.</hi>
                        </note> The Objection propoſed by S. <hi>Jerom</hi> in his Commentaries on <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> that is taken from the Paſſages of the old Teſtament, which the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of this Epiſtle hath not cited from the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text, but from the <hi>Greek</hi> Verſion of the Seventy, is of no force at all: he ſhould have firſt made it appear that it was originally written in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> which cannot be eaſily proved; and though it were true, yet might it be always ſaid, as of the Goſpel of S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> that the <hi>Greek</hi> Tranſlator hath inſerted into his Verſion the Paſſages of the Old Teſtament according to the Septuagint, which was read at that time by the moſt part of the <hi>Jews.</hi>

                     <p>If we follow the Opinion of <hi>Origen</hi> who was well verſed in the Criticiſm of the Sacred Books, this Epiſtle hath been compoſed in <hi>Greek</hi> by one of the Scribes or Diſciples of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who hath only committed to Writing that which he learned from his Maſter. This may ſerve to anſwer another Objection that is ordinarily offered againſt this Epiſtle, by reaſon of the diverſity of Stile, which is pretended to be very different from that of the other Epiſtles of S. <hi>Paul.

                     <p>It is objected in the third place, that if this Epiſtle were S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s, he would have ſet his Name at the head of it, as he hath done in his other Epiſtles.<note place="margin">Theodor. Praef. Com. in Epiſt. ad Hebr.</note>

                     <p>There is a fourth Reaſon that appears to be much ſtronger than the preceding, againſt the aſcribing the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> to S. <hi>Paul.</hi>

                     <p>The Author of the Preface at the beginning of the Canonical Epiſtles, which is attributed to S. <hi>Jerom,</hi> and is found in the moſt part of Manuſcript Copies, and in the firſt <hi>Latin</hi> Editions of the Bible, hath obſerved<note n="(b)" place="bottom">Non ita eſt ordo apud Graecos qui integrè ſapiunt, fidemque rectam ſectan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, Epiſtolarum ſeptem quae Canonicae nuncupantur, ſicut in Latinis codicibus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venitur, ut quòd Petrus primus in ordine Apoſtolorum, prinae ſint etiam ejus Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolae in ordine caeterarum. <hi>Hieron.

The Epiſtle of S. <hi>James</hi> was the firſt in the <hi>Greek;</hi> whereas the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins</hi> had placed that of S. <hi>Peter</hi> at the head of all the reſt, having had regard to the Primacy of his Apoſtleſhip. This Author declares that he hath re-eſtabliſhed their ancient Order, putting that of St. <hi>James</hi> at the beginning, and afterwards the two of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> the three of St. <hi>John,</hi> and at laſt that of St. <hi>Jude:</hi> this indeed is the Order that is found in the <hi>Greek</hi> Manuſcript Copies, and even in the ancient Latin Bibles written about ſeven or eight hundred years ago. St. <hi>Jerom</hi> alſo hath followed this method in his great Prologue called <hi>Galeatus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Syrians</hi> have preſerved this ſame Order in their Verſion, as appears from the Edition of <hi>Widmanſtadius,</hi> nevertheleſs they have not in their ancient Copies (according to which this Edition of <hi>Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſtadius</hi> was regulated) the ſecond Epiſtle of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> nor the ſecond and third of St. <hi>John,</hi> nor that of St. <hi>Jude.</hi> Theſe Epiſtles were not apparently in the <hi>Greek</hi> Copies which the <hi>Syrians</hi> have Tranſlated into their Language: However it ſeems as if there were nothing very certain concerning the Order of theſe Epiſtles; for in the laſt of the Canons that bear the name of the Apoſtles, thoſe of St. <hi>Peter</hi> are ſet down firſt, and afterwards thoſe of St. <hi>John,</hi> and that of St. <hi>James</hi> ſtands in the third rank: the Biſhops aſſembled at <hi>Trent</hi> have alſo named them after this ſame manner, conformably to the Council of <hi>Florence.

But we ought to prefer the Order that is obſerved in the <hi>Greek</hi> and Latin Copies, and alſo in the Oriental Verſions.</p>
                     <p>As for what concerns the Authority of theſe Epiſtles, very great difficulties ariſe from thence; for as we have already ſeen, the <hi>Syri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> have not inſerted ſome of them in their Verſion of the New Teſtament, which they would have done if they had been read in the Eaſtern Churches, when they Interpreted them out of the <hi>Greek</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Syriack,</hi> nevertheleſs they have ſince Tranſlated them, and they have been likewiſe Printed; therefore they are alſo found in the <hi>Arabick</hi> Verſions of the New Teſtament.

For to ſay with <hi>Grotius,</hi> that theſe words <hi>Brother of</hi> James, have been afterwards added by the Tranſcribers that it might be believed that this <hi>Jude</hi> was certainly an Apoſtle, is to beg the queſtion; they that would prove that this hath been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted by the Tranſcribers ought to produce good Copies of this Epiſtle, or certain ancient Acts on which we might rely.

                     <p>It is true that the Epiſtle of St. <hi>Jude</hi> is leſs quoted by the ancient Doctors of the Church, than the moſt part of the other Books of the New Teſtament, and that it is not found in the ancient Copies of the <hi>Syriack</hi> Verſion.

                     <p>THE Reflections which many Learned Men have made on that Paſſage in the Firſt Epiſtle of S. <hi>John,</hi> Chap. v. verſ. 7. have not diſcouraged me from examining it afreſh, and conſulting the moſt part of the Greek and Latin Manuſcripts that I could find about the ſame.

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:96711:94"/>hard to find among the Greeks any Manuſcript Copies that have that Paſſage; I ſpeak not only of the Ancients, but alſo of thoſe of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter times. <hi>Eraſmus</hi> alledged the Greeks had their Books more cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect than the Latin Copies, but he is miſtaken, as it ſhall appear by what follows in this Diſcourſe. 'Tis much more probable, that that Doctrinal Point was formerly written the Margin, by way of Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium or Note, but afterward inſerted in the Text by thoſe who tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed the Copies. Such were my thoughts when I peruſed ſome of the Greek Editions; and there is no leſs probability, that it was ſupplied after the ſame manner in the antient Latin Copies; which nevertheleſs happened not till after S. <hi>Jerom</hi>'s time, who is not the Author of that Addition, which <hi>Socinus,</hi> next to <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> had laid to his charge.</p>
                     <p>After the moſt diligent ſearch in the King's Library, and that of Mr. <hi>Colbert,</hi> in which there are a great many good Manuſcript Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes, I found no Copy that had that Paſſage in it, tho I read ſeven of them in the Royal Library,<note place="margin">Codd. MSS. Bibl. Reg.</note> ſix whereof are marked 1885. 2247. 2248. 2870. 2871. 2872. Some of the Manuſcripts have Notes; but no Scholiaſt or Annotator does make mention of that Paſſage, neither have I found it in five Manuſcript Copies belonging to Mr. <hi>Colbert</hi>'s Library,<note place="margin">Codd. MSS. Bibl. Colb.</note> which are marked 871. 6123. 4785. 6584. 2844. Yet ſome of theſe Manuſcripts are only in Paper, and much later than the reſt. There is alſo one in 16, well written, and I believe ſince the Impreſſion: Yet the Paſſage in queſtion is not found therein, any more than in the reſt of the ancient Copies.</p>
                     <p>I could produce yet other Greek Manuſcript Copies which I have ſeen, whoſe various Readings I obſerved; but that which moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves our notice, is that in the Margin of ſome of the King's and Mr. <hi>Colbert</hi>'s Copies, there are ſmall Notes ſet over againſt the ſaid Paſſage, which in all likelihood have ſlipped afterwards into the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Text. Take an Example from the King's Copy, marked 2247. over againſt theſe words, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

By which we may perceive that the Author of the ſaid Remark, underſtood <hi>The Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> to be ſignified by the Three Witneſſes mentioned by S. <hi>John, The Spirit, the Water, and the Blood:</hi> And what was formerly written by way of Note, paſſed afterwards into the Text, as it often falls out.

                     <p>This, in my opinion, is the original of the Paſſage in queſtion, which 'tis very hard to find in the Greek Manuſcript Copies, tho at this day the read it in their Verſion. This is much more likely than what <hi>Eraſmus</hi> alledges; that the Greek Copies he had occaſion to inſpect, were much more correct than the Latin, which obliged that judicious perſon to omit the forementioned Paſſage in his firſt Editions of the New Teſtament; in which he was not altogether to be blamed, not being obliged to inſert in the Impreſſion what he could not find in any of his Manuſcripts; He has nevertheleſs been charged with a deſign of favouring the <hi>Arrian</hi> Party by the omiſſion. <hi>James Lopes Stunica</hi> has mightily accuſed him for his unlucky reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the ſaid Paſſage in his Edition,<note n="(b)" place="bottom">Sciendum eſt hoc loco Graecorum codices apertiſſimè eſſe corruptos; noſtros verò veritatem ipſam ut à primâ origine traducti ſunt continere: quod ex Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logo Beati Hieronymi ſuper Epiſtolas Canonicas manifeſtè apparet. <hi>Jac.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Eraſmus</hi> in his anſwer to <hi>Stunica,</hi> does vindicate himſelf well enough by the authority of thoſe Greek Copies he had; yet he was wrought upon by ſome other conſideration, contrary to the Authority of all his Manuſcripts, to inſert the Paſſage of S. <hi>John</hi> in a new Edition of his New Teſtament. He declares that what obliged him to make that Change, was his ſeeing a Greek Copy in <hi>England,</hi> which he believed was more perfect than any Latin Edition.

'Tis further obſervable, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Name of S. <hi>Jerome,</hi> nor of any other Writer, is prefixt to the Preface, in ſome of the ancient Copies where it is found, which ſufficiently ſhews, that we may on good grounds queſtion S. <hi>Jerome</hi>'s being the Author of it.</p>

                     <p>Whoever will take the pains to compare the moſt of the ancient Latin Bibles together, ſhall eaſily diſcover, that he who gathered all the Books of the Latin Bible into one Body, (the better part of which was tranſlated or reviſed by S. <hi>Jerome</hi>) is really the Author of that Preface. Since he was not furniſhed with that Father's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to all thoſe Books, he ſupplied, in his Collection, what was wanting with an addition of ſome of his own compoſure, and others, which he gathered from S. <hi>Jerome</hi>'s Works. Hence, for example, in <hi>Charles le Chauve</hi>'s Copy, there is, before the Acts of the Apoſtles, a Preface with this Title, <hi>Praefatio Hieronymi:</hi> Yet 'tis certain, that S. <hi>Jerome</hi> was not the Author of that Preface to the Acts, as it is there in expreſs words, but the Author of the Collection of the Books of the Latin Bible, took the ſame out of that Father's large Preface, entituled <hi>Prologus Galeatus;</hi> and it is expreſſed in theſe words, <hi>Actus Apoſtolorum nudam quidem reſanare hiſtoriam videntur, &amp; naſcentis Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiae hiſtoriam texere: Sed ſi noverimus ſcriptorem eorum Lucam eſſe Medicum, cujus laus in Evangelio, animadvertemus pariter omnia verba illius animae languentis eſſe Medicinam:</hi> that is, <hi>The Acts of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles ſeem to be a bare Hiſtory, affording us a proſpect of the Church in its Birth: But if we conſider that the Writer was</hi> Luke <hi>the Phyſician, who is famous in the Goſpel, we ſhall alſo perceive, that all his words are the Medicine of a languiſhing Soul.</hi> 'Tis alſo probable, that the Compiler of the Books of the Latin Verſion, which we call the Vulgar, not finding in S. <hi>Jerome</hi> a particular Preface to the Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Epiſtles, made one according to that Father's Stile, ſome of whoſe Expreſſions he has made uſe of, and amongſt others, has inſerted that word <hi>Euſtochium.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>'Tis likewiſe probable, that the Addition of the <hi>Witneſs of three Perſons</hi> was extant before that time, in ſome Copies of S. <hi>John</hi>'s Epiſtles, or at leaſt in ſome Latin Writers, at the time when that Preface was made. Upon this account the Author, who poſſibly had not the occaſion of conſulting the Creek Copies, ſuppoſed, that if that Paſſage was not extant in any Latin Copy, the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators were to be blamed. 'Tis obſervable that the Addition is not in moſt of the old Copies of S. <hi>Jerome</hi>'s Bible, to which neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:96711:96"/>the Preface is prefixt, as I have obſerved in two Copies, one whereof is in the Royal Library, and the other in that belonging to Mr. <hi>Colbert.</hi> How incongruous is it, to ſee a Preface at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Canonical Epiſtles, where S. <hi>Jerome</hi> complains of the unfaithfulneſs of the ancient Latin Tranſlators, who have omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Firſt Epiſtle of S. <hi>John,</hi> Chap. 1. a whole Verſe which he reſtores to the Greek; and yet, if one turn to the place of S. <hi>John</hi>'s Epiſtle in the very ſame Copy, the paſſage is not to be found there. There can be no other reaſon given, in my opinion, of this inco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herency, but this, that the Tranſcribers who writ out the Preface, made uſe of ſuch Latin Copies, in which that Verſe was not extant; becauſe neither S. <hi>Jerome,</hi> nor the antient Latin Verſion had any thing of it. If that Father had been the Author of the Preface, and of the Addition inſerted in S. <hi>John</hi>'s Epiſtle, that Addition would have been extant in all S. <hi>Jerome</hi>'s Latin Bibles. This diverſity of Copies is in my judgment an evident proof, that he did not compoſe that Preface to prefix it to the Canonical Epiſtles.</p>
                     <p>And that which makes it further manifeſt, that S. <hi>Jerome</hi> was not the true Author either of the Preface or Addition, is, that that Addition is placed in the Margin of moſe of the antient Copies, in the Body of which it is not extant. It was no leſs than ſurpriſing,<note n="(g)" place="bottom">Quantum à noſtrâ aliorum diſtet editio, lectoris judicio relinquo. <hi>Hier. Prol. in VII. Epiſt. Can.</hi>
                        </note> that the pretended S. <hi>Jerome</hi> ſhould in his Preface, commend his new Edition of the Canonical Epiſtles, upon the account of the change he had made, eſpecially in the Firſt of S. <hi>John,</hi> whilſt there was nothing of ſuch change or amendment to be ſeen therein. Upon which account the Tranſcribers, or they to whom the Copies did belong, thought fit to regulate the Text according to the Preface, by ſupplying, in the Margin, the Verſe concerning <hi>the Witneſs of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> which, before that time was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in ſome Eccleſiaſtical Authors. But ſince it was a matter of difficulty for thoſe who placed that Addition in the Margin of their Copies, to obſerve a general and perfect uniformity of words, it ſo fell out, that the Expreſſions in the various Copies did likewiſe vary. This diverſity does evidently prove that S. <hi>Jerome</hi> could not be the Author of the Addition in controverſie, but that it was done by thoſe who had a mind to adjuſt the Text in S. <hi>James</hi> to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face. I ſhall here give ſome Examples of that Regulation, of the manner how it was added to moſt of the old Latin Copies of S. <hi>Jerome</hi>'s Bible.</p>

The truth is, after I had ſtrictly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined that paſſage of St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> which is the matter in Queſtion, I fully perſuaded my ſelf that that Pious Prelate had only made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe words, <hi>&amp; hi tres unum ſunt,</hi> i.e. <hi>and theſe three are one,</hi> about which there is no conteſt, and that from thence he would prove, the <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>Son,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> to be one and the ſame. <hi>It is written</hi> (ſays he) of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>and theſe three are one.</hi> He applies to the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, what we read in all the Greek and Latine Copies concerning the teſtimony of the Spirit, the Water and the Blood, of which it is ſaid, that they are one, <hi>&amp; hi tres unum ſunt,</hi> which differs very much from an expreſs quotation of thoſe Words, as if they were in the Text it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>And that there may be no doubt left, but that this is St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s true ſenſe of the words, it is but conſulting the Learned <hi>Facundus,</hi> who was of the ſame <hi>African</hi> Church, and gives their explication at large, evincing the myſtery of the Trinity from them,<note place="margin">Facund. prodefenſ.

If he had only ſpoken of ſuch Greek Copies as were written by thoſe of the Latin Church, and which ſerved for their uſe, what he alledged, would be the more credible. But that the Greeks, after their reunion with the Latin Church, made their Copies of the New Teſtament more Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect than the Latin, is againſt all appearance of Truth. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, 'tis manifeſt that the Copies that have been ſince that time, make no mention of that Teſtimony.</p>

                     <p>The Obſervation that <hi>Fromondus,</hi> a Divine of <hi>Louvain,</hi> made on that place of St. <hi>John,</hi> after ſome other Commentators is without any ground. He acknowledged that St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> and many other Latin Fathers, had not that paſſage of St. <hi>John</hi> extant in their Copies; but at the ſame time he adds,<note n="(i)" place="bottom">Videneur Graeci Ariani ex multis codicibus Graecis primùm eraſiſſe, &amp; dein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de tranſlationem Latinam, quâ S.

                        </note> that the <hi>Arians</hi> had taken away the ſame out of many Copies, and that the Latin Verſion which St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> and thoſe other Fathers made uſe of, was compiled out of thoſe Books that were corrupted by the <hi>Arians.</hi> This opinion is moſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, and can have no other ground, but the Preface that is fathered on St. <hi>Jerome.</hi> With what reaſon could they accuſe the <hi>Arians</hi> of changing the Greek Copies of the New Teſtament in that place, ſeeing St <hi>Cyprian,</hi> who lived before <hi>Arius</hi>'s name was known in the World, had no ſuch Verſe in his Copy? Beſides, the ſame altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt of neceſſity have reached all other Churches: for neither the <hi>Syrians</hi> of any Sect whatſoever, nor any other Eaſtern Church have it in their Editions of the New Teſtament.</p>
                     <p>And I cannot imagin what advantage the <hi>Antitrinitarians</hi> can get againſt the Catholicks, upon this ground, that that paſſage is not found in the moſt part of the Greek Manuſcripts, nor thoſe others of the Eaſtern Church, nor yet in the old Latin Copies. For the moſt learned Interpreters of the New Teſtament do not Expound it with reference to the Trinity. Such ancient Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Writers as have applyed it to that Myſtery, followed the Cuſtom of that time, which was to give the Scripture ſuch a Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical ſenſe, as was accommodated to the Faith then received in the Church. Now whether that Verſe be Read in the I. Epiſtle of St. <hi>John,</hi> as all thoſe of the Greek and Latin Churches do at this day, or it be not Read; yet the Doctrine of the Trinity may always be very well proved from that place, againſt thoſe who deny that Myſtery; becauſe the Fathers from the firſt Ages of the Church, have applyed the Witneſs of the <hi>Spirit, of the Water, and of the Blood,</hi> to the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt. They have proved, by the Unity of thoſe Witneſſes, that the three Perſons of the Trinity are one.</p>
                     <p>It is therefore to no purpoſe to diſpute about the Addition or Omiſſion of a paſſage, which by it ſelf, does not clearly eſtabliſh, but only ſuppoſe a Trinity of Perſons, according to the opinion of the moſt Ancient Divines of the Church. I do not believe, that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:96711:99"/>the moſt of the Modern Divines had any intention of favouring <hi>Arianiſm,</hi> when they obſerved that that place ſhews that the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes are <hi>One. Thoſe three</hi> (ſays Father <hi>Amelote</hi>) <hi>are one</hi> in their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, the <hi>Father</hi> gave a Teſtimony to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> in <hi>Jordan.</hi> The <hi>Word,</hi> by his Words and Actions, the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> in the form of a Dove, and by his miraculous Gifts.</p>
                     <p>I cannot after all, in any wiſe conceive for what uſe or purpoſe <hi>Sandius</hi> has quoted,<note place="margin">Herman. Cingal. Script. S. Trinit. Revelat. <hi>p. 105.</hi>
                        </note> upon the credit of others, ſo many different Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the New Teſtament, in which the Verſe in queſtion is not to be found. Seeing the moſt part of thoſe Greek Editions were taken from one another, and but very few of them from Manuſcript Copies, their great number ſignifies nothing. I do not think, for example, that that of <hi>Strasburg, An.</hi> 1524. or that of <hi>Simon de Colines,</hi> at <hi>Paris, An.</hi> 1534. were compiled by the help of Manuſcripts. <hi>Wolfius,</hi> who publiſhed that of <hi>Strasburg,</hi> makes no mention of it in his Preface. On the contrary, he declares, that he only Reprinted in a new Letter, and another Volume, what had been Printed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time. <hi>Simon de Colines</hi> made no Preface to his Greek Editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; which makes me think he compiled it according ro the beſt of his skill, by Editions that were extant before. <hi>Eraſmus</hi> is one of the firſt, who gave occaſion for the omiſſion of that Verſe, in thoſe Greek Editions of the New Teſtament that came after his own, which was <hi>An.</hi> 1516. And he publiſhed another, <hi>An.</hi> 1519. where that Verſe is alſo wanting. Thoſe Editions, on the contrary, which came out after the Complute or <hi>Alcala, An.</hi> 1515. have all that Verſe. Hence it is, that it is extant in <hi>Robert Stephen</hi>'s Fair Edition, and in the moſt part of the other Editions. The Manuſcript, and not the Printed Copies, are to be heeded, unleſs theſe be taken from the Manuſcripts, ſuch as the Edition of <hi>Alcala,</hi> and that of <hi>Eraſmus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nor is there any account to be made of the great number of Editions, of <hi>Luther</hi>'s <hi>Dutch</hi> Verſion, that <hi>Sandius</hi> brings againſt the <hi>Lutherans.</hi> For they are only repetitions of the firſt, in which <hi>Luther</hi> had followed the Edition of <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> or ſome other, there being at that time many, even in <hi>Holland,</hi> which had been pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed without that Verſe. I do not think that that Patriarch of the North was well Read in the <hi>Greek</hi> Manuſcript Copies, though the moſt part of his followers do juſtifie him in this manner, when it is objected to them, that their Maſter has corrupted the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, by leaving out a paſſage of the New Teſtament, that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts the Myſtery of the Trinity.

                     <p>This is a plauſible Reaſon, becauſe <hi>Luther</hi> took upon him the Tranſlating a <hi>Greek</hi> Copy into his own Language.

On the contrary, the Author of the Revelation does name himſelf at the beginning, and frequently in the Body of his Work; for example, in the Letter he writes to the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi>
                        <pb n="20" facs="tcp:96711:103"/>he begins with theſe words, John <hi>to the ſeven Churches which are in Aſia.</hi> But St. <hi>John</hi> does not ſo much as put his name to his Catholick Epiſtle, in his entrance upon the matter.

                     <p>This difference of Stile makes <hi>Denis</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> to conclude, that the Revelation was not written by St. <hi>John;</hi> and he affirms at the ſame time, that it is uncertain who that <hi>John</hi> was.

Once he has recourſe to the difference of Stile, from which he pretends to prove, that the Apoſtle St. <hi>John,</hi> who writ the Goſpel, and one Epiſtle, cannot be the Author of the Apocalyps.

                     <p>In the laſt place, the Commentaries on the Apocalyps made by the <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> are undeniable proofs, that they do receive it into the number of Divine and Prophetical Books.

                     <p>Beſides the Books of the New Teſtament, which we have hitherto ſpoken of, and that are generally received in all the Churches, as Divine and Canonical, ſome others have been read in many Churches, which yet never had the ſame Authority. Nevertheleſs it has ſo fallen out, that thoſe who have made Catalogues of the Sacred Books, have not always obſerved this diſtinction. For they have placed all of them in an equal rank, for Books of the Holy Scripture. There have been alſo ſome Fathers, who quoted ſome Books of this ſort, as if they had been truely given by Divine Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. But it is eaſie to find, even by the Writings of the Fathers, that thoſe Works were approved by none but particular perſons, whoſe Opinion cannot reaſonably be looked upon as a Law. If I had not reſolved to confine my Diſcourſe to the Books of the New Teſtament, which are generally approved of in all Churches, I would have inſiſted at large on thoſe other Books, but I am obliged to keep within the limits of my firſt purpoſe.

                     <p>THE Books of the New Teſtament having been maintained, as well in general, as in particular, it is worth the while to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin the principal Objections that are made againſt thoſe Books; and at the ſame time againſt the Apoſtles who publiſhed them. The <hi>Mahometans</hi> endeavour to evince the neceſſity of the coming of their Prophet, from this, that ſeeing the Canonical Books of the <hi>Jews</hi> and Chriſtians, are (according to their Opinion,) wholly corrupted, it was neceſſary that God ſhould ſend a new Prophet upon the Earth, to teach Men the True Religion. But becauſe they bring no ſolid reaſons for the confirmation of what they alledge, it is to no purpoſe to refute them. The <hi>Jews</hi> and ſome Philoſophers, who are Enemies to the Chriſtians, have more particularly attacked the Writings of the Evangeliſts and Apoſtles. They have had the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence to charge them with Forgery, or at leaſt with ignorance, ſeeing (as they object) they have quoted the Books of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament otherwiſe than they are in themſelves. They further accuſe them, of annexing to the Paſſages they produce, a ſenſe that was very far from the mind of the Authors. Hereupon they draw up the ſtrongeſt objections they can, againſt the Authority of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament; which of neceſſity muſt be anſwered.</p>
                     <pb n="26" facs="tcp:96711:106"/>
                     <p>As to the firſt Objections; the <hi>Jews</hi> do ſuppoſe, that when a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Record is produced for confirmation of a Matter of Fact, it is neceſſary, that the very words of the Record be delivered in the ſame manner as they are in the Original, or in faithful Copies; but (ſay they) the Diſciples of Jeſus Chriſt have not done that. For if the paſſages of the Old Teſtament which they have quoted in their Writings, be compared with the Original <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text, it will be found, that in many places they bear a quite different mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Whence they conclude that they are either chargeable with falſhood, or that their Writings have been altered, and therefore that there is no credit to be given to them.</p>
                     <p>I anſwer this Objection, that it was not neceſſary for the Apoſtles, when they Preached the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, to make uſe of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Bible. On the contrary, it was more for their purpoſe that they ſhould make mention of the paſſages of the Old Teſtament, ſo as they were read in the <hi>Greek</hi> Copies that were in the Hands of the moſt part of the World. Very few of the <hi>Jews</hi> at that time underſtood the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Language: whereas the <hi>Greek</hi> Language was ſpread through the whole Empire. Since therefore Jeſus Chriſt did not ſend his Diſciples to Preach the Goſpel to a handful of Learned <hi>Jews,</hi> who underſtood the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> but to all the Nations of the Earth, the moſt part whereof ſpake <hi>Greek;</hi> they ought not only to ſpeak in that Language, but alſo to report the paſſages of the Old Teſtament, after the ſame manner as had been written for a long time in the ſame Language. There was at that time, a <hi>Greek</hi> Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the whole Bible, that had been made by <hi>Jews</hi> many Ages before, and therefore could not be ſuſpected. And ſo the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts and the Apoſtles could not juſtly be charged with falſhood, for quoting paſſages otherwiſe than they were in the Original, ſince they made uſe of ſuch Writings as were approved by the <hi>Jews,</hi> and were in uſe amongſt them.</p>
                     <p>It is true, that if they to whom the Goſpel was Preached, had underſtood the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Language, it had been better to quote the Original <hi>Hebrew,</hi> than the <hi>Greek</hi> Verſion of the LXX, becauſe the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal ought always to be preferred to Tranſlations. But as things were then, the Apoſtles acted moſt wiſely, in preferring the <hi>Greek</hi> Copy of the Bible to the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> which was underſtood almoſt by none. And therefore the Church from its firſt beginning, had no other Scripture but the Ancient <hi>Greek</hi> Verſion; and the whole Eaſtern Church, (the <hi>Syrians</hi> being excepted) have no other at this day.</p>
                     <p>I do not think it neceſſary to prove, that the Apoſtles, in their Writings, quoted the paſſages of the Old Teſtament, according to the <hi>Greek</hi> of the Septuagint, and not according to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:96711:106"/>It requires no extraordinary skill in both the Languages, to make one capable of judging aright in this matter. It is certain that<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Crebrò dixiſſe me novi, Apoſtolos &amp; Evangeliſtas ubicunque de Veteri In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumento ponunt teſtimonia, ſi inter Hebraicum &amp; Septuaginta nulla diverſitas ſit, vel ſuis, vel Septuaginta Interpretum verbis uti ſolitos.

                     <p>It will appear therefore, that St. <hi>Jerom</hi> in that place does give an anſwer to his Adverſaries, and endeavours as much as in him lies, to make an honorable retreat.<note place="margin">Hieron. ibid.</note>

                        <hi>That when the Apoſtles, or Apoſtolical Men ſpeak to the people, they commonly make uſe of ſuch teſtimonies as had been publiſhed before that time amongſt the Nations.</hi> That is to ſay, of the Verſion of the Septuagint, which being written in <hi>Greek,</hi> was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed amongſt all thoſe Nations which ſpoke the Language, whereas the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text was only read in the <hi>Jews</hi> Synagogues. He proves by the ſame Principle, that St. <hi>Luke,</hi> (when he wrote the Acts of the Apoſtles, to declare to the Nations, the firſt beginnings of the Chriſtian Religion) was to quote the Paſſages of the Old Teſtament, in the ſame manner as they were in the Verſion of the Scripture, which was before that time ſpread amongſt the People.</p>
                     <p>There is therefore nothing ſo abſurd as the Opinion of ſome Proteſtants, who (notwithſtanding the agreement that is found be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the quotations of the Apoſtles, and the <hi>Greek</hi> Verſion of the LXX) maintain with no ſmall Zeal, that the Apoſtles reported the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:96711:107"/>Paſſages of the Old Teſtament according to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text. They attribute that agreement to ſome Writers, whom they ſuppoſe to have lived after the times of the Apoſtles, and who (according to their Opinion) corrected the Verſion of the Septuagint, in all ſuch Paſſages as are quoted in the New Teſtament. The Evangeliſts and the Apoſtles (ſay they) regarded the ſenſe only, and not the Words of Scripture. If any one ask theſe Men the Reaſon why they maintain ſo ſtrange a Paradox, their anſwer will be but this<note n="(c)" place="bottom">Quis credat ſpiritum Apoſtolorum ſpiritui Graeculi interpretis ſe ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſe, aut limpidos fontes coenoſis Helleniſtarum rivulis praetuliſſe; &amp; ubi paſſim de capite aliquo Religionis adverſus Judeos agebatur, Apoſtolos, relicto Canone He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braeo, Lesbiam Graecorum regulam uſurpaſſe. <hi>Auctor.

                        </note> but through a Pious condeſcendency, and by a true Chriſtian Prudence, they followed the <hi>Greek</hi> Verſion which was publickly received, it being indifferent to them to quote the <hi>Hebrew</hi> or the <hi>Greek</hi> in thoſe Paſſages.</p>
                     <p>Although the Apoſtles did prefer the <hi>Greek</hi> of the Septuagint, to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text, it cannot be inferred from thence, that the <hi>Greek</hi> Verſion is better than the <hi>Hebrew</hi> of the <hi>Jews,</hi> as ſome Authors, eſpecially amongſt the Catholicks, have too eaſily believed. We ought to conſider by what motives the Apoſtles were led, to give this preference to the <hi>Greek.</hi> Seeing they did it for no other end, but to accommodate themſelves to the capacity of the People, whom they inſtructed, and who read the Bible in <hi>Greek,</hi> there can be no conſequence drawn from thence, to give more Authority to the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:96711:107"/>Verſion of the Septuagint than to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text, which they did not meddle with. In the <hi>Hebrew</hi> or <hi>Chaldaick</hi> Goſpel of St. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi> the Paſſages of the Old Teſtament were quoted according to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text; becauſe the <hi>Jews</hi> of <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> for whoſe ſake it was written, read the Bible in that Language. The People, who at that time underſtood not the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Language, had Gloſſes on the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text, written in the <hi>Chaldee,</hi> ſo that if that Evangeliſt had quoted the Bible in the vulgar Language, he had quoted the ſame according to the <hi>Chaldaick</hi> Gloſſes, and not according to the <hi>Greek</hi> of the Septuagint, which was not in uſe amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> of <hi>Paleſtine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It will further appear, that the Evangeliſts and the Apoſtles did not confine themſelves in their quotations to the rigor of the Letter, becauſe that was in no wiſe needful for carrying on their Work. They did content themſelves ſometimes, with delivering the ſenſe of the Words, which they adapted to their Diſcourſe. A thing commonly practiſed; and they cannot be branded with Falſhood or Impoſture, who ſet down after this manner, ſuch Records in their Works, as ſerve for proofs. A Copy of Record cannot be alledged to be falſe, unleſs the ſenſe be changed. But this can never be found in the quotations of the Apoſtles, who followed a received cuſtom, and which could be blamed by none. The ſame thing happened to moſt of the Fathers, when they quoted in the Works, the Paſſages of Scripture; for they made no ſcruple to change the Words, ſo long as that change was of no importance to the Senſe. Which ought to be the Standard of our Judgment, about the Paſſages of the Old Teſtament, which are quoted in the Writings of the Evangeliſts and Apoſtles, for though they were taken from the <hi>Greek</hi> Verſion, they do not always expreſs the very Words.</p>
                     <p>I know it may be objected, that this Verſion has very much degenerated from its ancient purity, and that therefore, it can no more ſerve as a Rule by which we may judge of the Truth of the Apoſtolical quotations. But what ever change has hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to this Tranſlation, it is ſufficient as it remains, to decide the matter of Fact we are now about. It is agreed by all the ancient Eccleſiaſtical Authors, that the Evangeliſts and Apoſtles, in the Paſſages they quote out of the Old Teſtament, were more ready to expreſs the Senſe than the Words: which is the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe Words of St. <hi>Jerom,</hi>

                     <p>But it is probable, that the ancient reading of the Septuagint was agreeable to St. <hi>Matthew;</hi> and at this day it is extant in the

And here 'tis obſervable, that although that of <hi>Rome,</hi> is the beſt of all the Editions of the Septuagint, becauſe it is the moſt ancient and pure of any of them, yet it is not free from errors. 'Tis to be ſuppoſed, that long before <hi>Origen,</hi> the <hi>Greek</hi> of the Septuagint was altered in ſome places, by ſome half-learned Men, whether <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who were far from a through knowledg of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Language, but rather conſulted their Dictionaries about the <hi>Hebrew</hi> words of the Bible; I believe that that place of <hi>Jeremy,</hi> is of the number of thoſe which were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in the Septuagint.</p>
                     <p>Amendments of that nature were then only placed in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin of the <hi>Greek</hi> Copies, by way of Notes; to ſhew that the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> words might have been interpreted in another manner, and it happened afterwards, that the <hi>Marginal</hi> Note or reading paſſed into the Text: Seeing it was the cuſtom at that time, to have Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionaries of the words of every famous Author; I make no Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, but that there was alſo compoſed a Dictionary, containing the words of the Bible, and alſo of every Book thereof in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.

St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> who had not conſidered this, judged of the Verſion of the Septuagint by the Copy which he had; and took no notice that that Verſion was altered by falſe Gloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in the moſt ancient Copies; and even a long time before <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen,</hi> whoſe critical obſervations afforded no remedy for that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection.

                     <p>But in my opinion, ſeeing St. <hi>John</hi> did follow the Septuagint more than the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> in all the Paſſages of his Goſpel, there is no reaſon to maintain, that, in that place, he conſulted the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py of the <hi>Jews;</hi> without any regard to the <hi>Greek</hi> Verſion of the Septuagint: Which makes me believe, that at the beginning, it was read in the Septuagint, as it was in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and in St. <hi>John.</hi> The change of Letters of that nature, gave occaſion of altering the true and ancient Text in other places: And this happened to that Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of <hi>Zechary,</hi> which ought to be amended in the <hi>Greek</hi> Verſion
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:96711:110"/>of the Septuagint, according to the reading in the Goſpel of St. <hi>John.</hi> That which does confirm this Opinion, is, that St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> did read it after that manner, in the ancient Latin Verſion, which was taken from the Septuagint: The Rendition of that Father has more Authority in this caſe, than that of ſome <hi>Greek</hi> Scholiaſts, who have alſo read it <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <hi>they inſulted;</hi> as it is in St. <hi>John,</hi> agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text. For theſe Scholiaſts in their Expoſitions, do frequently follow <hi>Aquila,</hi> or ſome other <hi>Greek</hi> Interpreter with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out declaring that they do ſo: And therefore 'tis neceſſary that we be cautious herein, that we do not confound the Verſion of the Septuagint, with other ancient <hi>Greek</hi> Interpreters.</p>
                     <p>This ſhould be the place for the examples of the alterations we ſpake of, whereby the ancient Greek Rendition was very much changed; but it would take up too much time: It ſuffices that we have touched ſomething of it, in general, to juſtifie the Citations of the Evangeliſts and of the Apoſtles. Neither will I ſtay, to examin particularly, ſome other Paſſages of the Old Teſtament, which St. <hi>Jerome</hi> pretends to have been cited by the Apoſtles, in their Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, rather according to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> than according to the Septua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gint. For beſides that it does require a long time to diſcuſs them, the rules that are confirmed already, are ſufficient to Anſwer all that Father's Objections, who himſelf has acknowledged, in many places of his Works, that the Diſciples of Jeſus Chriſt, who Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Goſpel to a People that ſpake the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue, muſt have made uſe of the ancient <hi>Greek</hi> Verſion of the Septuagint, which was in the hands of every one; and not of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Bible, which was read by none but the <hi>Jews:</hi> Beſides there were but few amongſt them, who could have underſtood it. We come now to the other Objection, which is brought againſt the Books of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and which conſiſts in a ſuppoſition, that the Apoſtles and the Evangeliſts have not only changed the words of the Paſſages which they cite, but that they have likewiſe wreſted the ſame, by giving them a ſenſe altogether different from the meaning of the Authors.</p>

XXI.</hi> A Diſcuſſion of ſome other Objections againſt the Books of the New Teſtament: The Evangeliſts and Apoſtles (in the manner of their explaining the Paſſages of the Old Teſtament, and applying them to the <hi>Meſſiah</hi>) followed the Cuſtom which then obtained amongſt the <hi>Jews.</hi> There are many words in the New Teſtament, which have a larger ſignification than they have in the Old: And that can be attributed to nothing but to that uſage, and to a tradition received amongſt the <hi>Jews.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>THE Preſent Times gave not a beginning to the very great and difficult Objections, that have been formed againſt the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the Old Teſtament, which the Evangeliſts and Apoſtles have made uſe of in their Writings, for the Confirmation of the Truth of the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Celſus, Porphyrius, Julian</hi> and the <hi>Jews</hi> have brought them againſt the Chriſtians, that they might thereby ſhew, (as they think) the weakneſs of thoſe Proofs, upon which the Chriſtian Religion is founded: But they are deceived, when they perſwade themſelves, that Chriſtianity has nothing elſe but ſuch ſort of Proofs, for its Foundation. The Miracles of Jeſus Chriſt are evident Proofs of his Miſſion: And therefore, if it ſhould be ſuppoſed with them, that the Paſſages we ſpeak of, are not always juſtly applyed, it cannot be concluded from thence, that the Chriſtian Religion is built on a falſe Foundation.</p>
                     <p>That we may make a right judgment of the Reaſonings of Jeſus Chriſt and his Diſciples, in the Books of the New Teſtament, we muſt have recourſe to the practice of the <hi>Jews</hi> at that time; and if it be proved, that their manner of reaſoning and applying to the <hi>Meſſias</hi> certain Paſſages of Scripture, is agreeable to the uſage of that time, they cannot without great injuſtice be blamed. They will be ſufficiently acquitted of that which is charged upon them, if we conſult the ancient Books of the <hi>Jews,</hi> eſpecially the <hi>Chaldaick</hi> Paraphraſes, and the <hi>Medraſchim,</hi> or ancient Allegorical Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries. They have; in thoſe Works, attributed to the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> many
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:96711:111"/>Places of Scripture, which ſeem to have a quite different ſenſe, if the Letter be only conſidered.</p>
                     <p>The Rabbins likewiſe give two ſenſes to many Paſſages, one of which is merely Hiſtorical, and another that is more large, which in ſome ſort may be called Myſtical or Allegorical; although in effect it is as much literal in its own nature as the former. Thus they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the ſame Paſſage of <hi>David,</hi> and of the <hi>Meſſias:</hi> All their old <hi>Medraſchim</hi> or Allegorical Commentaries, which are the moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Expoſitions that they have of the Bible, follow this Method. Their Doctors never began to inſiſt on the literal ſenſe, till they had occaſion to diſpute with the Chriſtians: and it was eaſie to make Anſwer to them, according to no other Principles than thoſe which they themſelves had eſtabliſhed. Why then do they think it ſtrange, that the Evangeliſts and Apoſtles, who came from amongſt them, ſhould make uſe of the ſame Principles to oppoſe them? Why do they perſwade us, that in the matter of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> there ought to be no ſuch Proofs uſed, as are Founded on the Myſtical &amp; Allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical ſenſe of Scriptures, ſince they themſelves have always obſerved that Method?</p>
                     <p>The truth is, if the <hi>Jews</hi> be much preſs'd about thoſe Paſſages of the Old Teſtament, which they make uſe of to confirm the belief of a <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> which they have placed amongſt the Fundamental Articles of their Religion; it will be hard enough for them to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer thoſe Objections that may be brought againſt them upon the point; unleſs they have recourſe to thoſe Myſtical and Allegori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſenſes, which being Founded upon the Tradition of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ought to paſs for real Proofs. There has been a certain Rabbin amongſt their ancient Doctors, who abſolutely denied that the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> ſhould come, becauſe he did not believe, that it was Founded upon the literal and evident Proofs of Scripture. They did not, for all that, exclude him from their Communion; by which it does appear, that the Article was not yet (at that time) in the number of thoſe they call Fundamental.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> do renounce their Principle, when they object againſt the Diſciples of Jeſus Chriſt, that their Expoſitions are not purely literal, but Allegorical, and that there can nothing be concluded from an Allegory. 'Tis true, that that which is meerly Allegorical cannot ſuffice as a poſitive Proof for the Confirmation of a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: But when thoſe Allegories are Founded on Tradition, they may be uſed and applyed to Matters of Fact, which are already agreed upon by that Tradition. In this manner, all the Objections of the <hi>Jews</hi> may be Anſwered, without a particular enumeration of thoſe Paſſages, which they pretend to have been falſly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied

                     <p>This Principle is ſo true, that the <hi>Antitrinitarians,</hi> (who refuſe to receive the Traditions of the Catholicks, in the Diſputes betwixt them, and who do only admit the Literal Expoſitions of Scripture, without any dependance on Tradition) do plainly ſee themſelves obliged to acknowledge ſome other Senſe than what is Literal, when they are to enter into the Liſts with the <hi>Jews.</hi> This does plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the Works of <hi>Socinus, Enjedine,</hi> and of ſome other <hi>Unita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</hi> In which they give evident proofs of the inconſtancy of their Principle.

And therefore, ſo long as the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſhall with bare Reaſons, oppoſe the Expoſition of the Paſſages of the Old Teſtament, which the Evangeliſts and the Apoſtles have cited in the New, they cannot poſſibly conclude any thing againſt them. For it will be eaſily demonſtrated, that thoſe Writers, in that matter, followed the cuſtom and Tradition of their Time.</p>
                     <p>The Book where the moſt of that ſort of citations are found, is the Epiſtle of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> where we find nothing elſe but Paſſages of the Old Teſtament, explained in a manner that is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together Allegorical and Foreign to the Letter; which has alſo given an occaſion to ſome Writers to ſuſpect that St. <hi>Paul</hi> was not the Author.

                        <hi>when Chriſt,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Enjedine</hi>) explained that Paſſage in a myſtical Senſe, he did nothing but what was very pertinent: for there were three Sects amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> at that time. The <hi>Sadducees</hi> did only receive the Literal Senſe of the Scripture. The <hi>Phariſees</hi> on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, beſides the Literal, did alſo approve of the Myſtical Senſe. And therefore in his Diſputing with the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> he followed a Cuſtom in which they were agreed, that is, of giving Myſtical Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions to Scripture. Seeing he knew that the Pſalm, which was underſtood of <hi>Solomon,</hi> or rather of <hi>David,</hi> according to the Literal Senſe, was ordinarily applied to the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> he freely declares that <hi>David</hi> had the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> in his view, when he writ it. Which the <hi>Phariſees</hi> could not deny, unleſs they would have renounced their own Sect.</p>
                     <p>This obſervation of <hi>Enjedine,</hi> does agree with the Principle which was formerly eſtabliſhed in this Diſcourſe for anſwering the <hi>Jews,</hi> who accuſed the Evangeliſts, and the Apoſtles, of giving falſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations to the Paſſages of the Old Teſtament. I will further ſay, that there were certain Traditions, which were not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> but alſo by the other Sects. I reckon in the number of thoſe Traditions, the belief of a <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> which it would have been hard to prove, only by the Books of <hi>Moſes.</hi> Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> who owned nothing but the <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> to be Divine and Canonical Scripture, did believe at that time, and ſtill believe the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> at this day: and the ground that they have for it, is taken from ſome Paſſages of the Law, which appear to have ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Senſe, if they be Interally Expounded. Whence I conclude, that this Spiritual and Myſtical Senſe, was not only in uſe amongſt the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> but alſo amongſt the other Sects. Nevertheleſs the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:96711:113"/>
                        <hi>Phariſees</hi> had abuſed it, by allowing it too great a latitude. And therefore our Lord does ſometimes reproach them, for this bad uſe which they had made of Traditions, yet without condemning the Traditions themſelves. The <hi>Jews Caraites</hi> alſo, who very much deſpiſed the Fables that abound in the <hi>Talmud,</hi> do not abſolutely reject all the Traditions which are contained in that Book.</p>
                     <p>If the <hi>Unitaries</hi> would make a juſt reflection on the Principle which has eſtabliſhed, and which may ſerve as an anſwer to the moſt part of the objections of the <hi>Jews</hi> againſt the Books of the Old Teſtament, they would not ſo much inſiſt upon the Literal Expoſition of certain Paſſages of Scripture, which they oppoſe to the Theological Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of the ancient Fathers. Seeing the <hi>Jews</hi> have Authoriſed, by their Traditions, ſome Interpretations of the Old Teſtament, that are in no wiſe Literal: the Doctors of the Church have alſo uſed the like in their Expoſition of Scripture. Interpretations of that kind are found in all the ancient Eccleſiaſtical Writers.

St. <hi>Jerom</hi> obſerves that they underſtood it of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> the Son of <hi>Achaz,</hi> becauſe <hi>Samaria</hi> was invaded under his Reign. But he does ſolidly refute them, by making it appear to them, that <hi>Achaz</hi> was already far advanced in years before he came to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. He brings, in the ſame place, another Expoſition of a<note n="(u)" place="bottom">Quidam de noſtris judaizans Eſaiam Prophetam duos filios habuiſſe contendit, Jeſub &amp; Emmanuel; &amp; Emmanuel de Prophetiſsâ uxore ejus eſſe generatum in typum Domini Salvatoris. <hi>Hieron. ibid.</hi>

But whatever St. <hi>Jerom</hi> does ſay of it, I do not perceive, that there is any thing affirmed therein, but what is altogether con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant to the Principles of the Chriſtian Religion, and alſo to thoſe which he does elſewhere maintain. That Propheſie, as the moſt part of the reſt, has a double Senſe: the one, which is here ſpoken of, has relation to the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi>'s Wife, the other, which is of a greater latitude, and may be called Spiritual or Myſtical, does point at the times of the <hi>Meſſiah;</hi> and it is alſo in ſome manner Literal, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is founded on the Theology and Traditions of the <hi>Jews.</hi> It will be eaſie to anſwer their objections, by ſuppoſing theſe two Senſes: whereas if the Expoſition of that Propheſie be rigorouſly reſtrained to the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> it will be more difficult to ſatisfie them. Seeing this Principle is of great importance, and may be uſeful for the reſolution of many difficulties of this nature, it is fit to confirm it by the Authority of the ancient Eccleſiaſtical Writers, and chiefly St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> who has mentioned it in his Commentaries upon the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Daniel. Porphyrius</hi> did pretend that there is nothing in that Book but what is Hiſtorical. He applyed to <hi>Antiochus</hi> that which
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:96711:115"/>the Chriſtians Expound of Antichriſt, aand the end of the World. The Chriſtians nevertheleſs, did not wholly reject the Interpretation of <hi>Porphyrius;</hi> but they affirmed that <hi>Antiochus</hi> was a Type of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt. <hi>Typum eum volunt,</hi> (ſays St. <hi>Jerom</hi> in ſpeaking of the ancient Doctors of the Church) <hi>Antichriſti habere, &amp; quae in illo ex parte praeceſſerint, in Antichriſto ex toto eſſe implenda.</hi> And to make their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion the more clear, he further adds this excellent Maxim:<note n="(x)" place="bottom">Hunc eſſe morem Scripturae Sanctae, ut futurorum veritatem praemittat in typis, juxta illud quod de Domino Salvatore in <hi>71.</hi> Pſalm dicitur, qui praenotatur Salomonis, &amp; omnia quae de eo dicuntur Salomoni non valent convenire. <hi>Apud Hieron.

                     <p>AS it would require much time, ſo it is of no uſe, to explain here all the Paſſages of the Old Teſtament, which the Evangeliſts and the Apoſtles have cited in their Writings, becauſe Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors may be conſulted thereupon, eſpecially <hi>Maldonat</hi> and <hi>Grotius,</hi> who commonly follow the Principle that we have already eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. That Principle did appear ſo much the more reaſonable, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing equally founded on a joint ſuffrage of the <hi>Jews</hi> and Chriſtians: Seeing I deſign to give general Rules, for anſwering the Objections of the <hi>Jews,</hi> againſt the Books of the New Teſtament, 'tis ſufficient, if I only take notice of ſome of thoſe citations, by which means theſe Rules may be the more manifeſt.</p>
                     <p>One of the places that are moſt difficult to be reconciled, is the Paſſage of the Prophet <hi>Micah,</hi> which is cited in the eleventh Chap. of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> v. 6.<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Quod teſtimonium nec Hebraico nec Septuaginta Interpretibus convenire, me quoque tacente, perſpicuum eſt. <hi>Hieron. lib. 2. in Mic. c. 5.</hi>
                        </note> St. <hi>Jerome</hi> does aſſure us, that it is as clear as the day, that it does neither agree with the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text, nor with the <hi>Greek</hi> of the Septuagint.

                        </note> that the Evangeliſts and Apoſtles were not at all exact in their citations, becauſe they truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their memory: But ſeeing this Anſwer does rather deſtroy than eſtabliſh the truth of the Goſpels, he has recourſe to another ſolution. He ſays, that they are the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Doctors, who ſpeak in that place; ſo that St. <hi>Matthew</hi> intending to ſhew, that thoſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:96711:116"/>neglected the ſtudy of the Scripture, has cited that Paſſage in the ſame manner as they had delivered it. But it does not at all appear, that the Evangeliſt meant to accuſe them of ignorance.</p>
                     <p>Yet it cannot be denied, but that they were <hi>Jews</hi> who ſpake to <hi>Herod,</hi> to whom we ought conſequently to impute the citation of that Paſſage of <hi>Micah.</hi> St. <hi>Matthew</hi> as an Hiſtorian, does only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port that which paſſed betwixt <hi>Herod</hi> and the Principal Doctors of the <hi>Jews.</hi> That Prince did ask them, where their <hi>Meſſiah</hi> ſhould be Born; they made Anſwer, that he ſhould be Born in <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> of the Tribe of <hi>Juda;</hi> and they proved it by that Paſſage of the Prophet <hi>Micah, and thou</hi> Bethlehem <hi>in the Land of</hi> Judah, <hi>art not the leaſt amongſt the Princes of</hi> Judah, <hi>for out of thee a Governor ſhall come, who ſhall rule my People</hi> Iſrael. If this is not a faithful citation, the error ought not to be imputed to St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> but to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Doctors who ſpake it. Was it poſſible (they may ſay) that all the Learned Men who were in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> at that time, ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in citing a Paſſage that was ſo well known to them? Ought they not to have reported it, as it is in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text, where we read that <hi>Bethlehem</hi> is a little City? On the contrary the Doctors af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, in St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> that it was not a little one.</p>
                     <p>Some Commentators have endeavour'd to reconcile this contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, by ſuppoſing the <hi>Jews</hi> to have read that place with an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogation: And the truth is, ſeeing there are no marks in the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> for ſuch Interrogations; it may be expounded in that ſenſe, without changing the Prophetical Text; which it were eaſie to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm by many Examples from the Writings of the <hi>Jews. Gabriel Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onita</hi> has alſo tranſlated the <hi>Syriack</hi> in that place, with an Interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though it be wholly agreeable to the <hi>Hebrew.

                     <p>Mr. <hi>Pocock</hi> found another way of reconciling thoſe two places, without having recourſe to an interrogation: He does alledge, that the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>This critical Obſervation of St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> upon the 11.

Chap. of St. <hi>Matthew:</hi> The truth is, 'twas the cuſtom of that Learned Father, in his Commentaries upon the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, rather to report that which he had read in other Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators, than to eſtabliſh an opinion of his own. And therefore, 'tis not ſurpriſing if we ſometimes do find oppoſite opinions therein: Nevertheleſs his Learning does afford us great help, for finding out the ſenſe of the moſt difficult Paſſages of the Sacred Writings. The Opinion of thoſe who believed that St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> in that place, had cited the Paſſage of Chap. 11. of the Prophet <hi>Eſay,</hi> ſeems, in my opinion to be the moſt probable. 'Tis very likely, that St. <hi>Jerome</hi> did apply it to the <hi>Nazarenes,</hi> when he ſays, in his Commentary up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Prophet, that the Learned amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> took it from that place: <hi>Eruditi Hebraeorum de hoc loco aſſumptum putant.</hi> Thoſe <hi>Hebrews</hi> are the Sect of the <hi>Nazarenes,</hi> who were called <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and who were ſo in effect: Seeing they read the Goſpel of St. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> in the <hi>Chaldee</hi> or <hi>Syriack,</hi> the alluſion to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word <hi>net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer,</hi> that is in <hi>Eſay,</hi> is better known in their Copy than in the <hi>Greek;</hi> and it was alſo better perceived by thoſe who had the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Chaldaick</hi> Languages.</p>
                     <p>That we make a right judgment hereof, that Paſſage of St. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> ought to be read in the <hi>Syriack</hi> Verſion, which in that place, ſhould not differ from the Original <hi>Chaldee</hi> of St. <hi>Matthew:</hi> But the <hi>Syrians</hi> do read theſe two words, <hi>Nazareth</hi> and <hi>Nazarene</hi> alike, with the letter <gap reason="foreign">

If the <hi>Jews</hi> could but ſeriouſly reflect on all theſe conſiderations, they would not brand, with the title of either falſe or ridiculous, the citation of St. <hi>Matthew;</hi> who has (ſay they) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted the words of the Prophet <hi>Eſay,</hi> to apply them to their <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah.</hi> For, ſeeing that Evangeliſt, writing for <hi>Jews</hi> who were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining to embrace the Religion of Jeſus Chriſt, did follow the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom and uſage that obtained at that time amongſt them: Unleſs we go back to that ancient cuſtom; we ſhall meet with great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties in the moſt part of the Paſſages of the Old Teſtament, which the Evangeliſts and Apoſtles have cited in their Writings, for the confirmation of their own Sentiments.</p>
                     <p>We ought to purſue this Method, for anſwering the <hi>Jews</hi> ſolid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; we are to repreſent to them the courſe their Fathers took, which, unleſs they renounce their Religion, they cannot reject.

                     <p>By the Principles that we have eſtabliſhed, it will be very eaſie to reſolve the moſt part of the other Objections which the <hi>Jews</hi> do raiſe againſt the Citations which are found throughout the Books of the New Teſtament. The Apoſtles, who did exactly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Expoſitions which were in uſe in their time, have obſerved the ſame method, almoſt through all their Writings. The <hi>Jews</hi> could not oppoſe them without deſtroying their own Principles, and favouring at the ſame time the <hi>Saddùcees.</hi> According to this method St. <hi>Matthew</hi> applyed to St. <hi>John</hi> the words of the Prophet <hi>Eſay, The voice of one crying in the wilderneſs, make ſtraight the way of the Lord.</hi> It is manifeſt that the Evangeliſt did, by a <hi>deras,</hi> or Spiritual and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legorical Senſe, Expound that which we ought to underſtand Liter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and Hiſtorically of the returning of the <hi>Jews</hi> from their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity out of <hi>Babylon</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>

                     <p>Beſides all thoſe obſervations which ſerve as Principles for anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Objections of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the Emperor <hi>Julian,</hi> this is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe remarkable, that there are many words in the New Teſtament, which have a larger Senſe than in the Old, which can be only at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the Cuſtom of that time, and to a Tradition received amongſt the <hi>Jews.</hi> There is nothing in the Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that does afford us any clear diſcovery of the ſtate of a future Life, which the <hi>Jews</hi> do call <hi>olam habba,</hi> i.e. <hi>The World to come,,</hi> there is no ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt Record in the ancient Law, of a Heaven or a Hell, any more than there is of a Recompence to the Juſt, and Puniſhment to the Wicked in that other Life. Neither have they proper words to expreſs thoſe things; they are obliged to make uſe of Metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical terms. The word <hi>Gehenna,</hi> for example, which is taken from the <hi>Hebrew Gehennam,</hi> has quite another Senſe in the Books of the Old Teſtament, than in the New, where it does ſignifie the Fire of Hell. Which made St. <hi>Jerom</hi> ſay<note n="(p)" place="bottom">Nomen gehennae in veteribus libris non invenitur, ſed primùm à Salvatore ponitur. <hi>Hieron. Comm. in Matth.</hi>
                        </note> that he does not find the word <hi>Gehenna</hi> in ancient Books; that Jeſus Chriſt is the firſt who uſed it. Yet this does not prove that he was in effect the firſt that uſed it in that Senſe, as it is in the New Teſtament; for it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time in uſe amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> in the ſame very Senſe, and eſpecially amongſt the <hi>Phariſees.</hi> St. <hi>Jerom</hi> meant no more than
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:96711:121"/>this, that he did not find it, in the Old Teſtament, under that ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, although their Paraphraſts, and their moſt ancient Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins uſed it in the ſame Senſe as Jeſus Chriſt did afterwards.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Hebrew</hi> word <hi>Sceol</hi> will come under the ſame conſideration, for in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> of the Old Teſtament, it does ſignifie a Sepulchre; it is almoſt every where in the Septuagint, rendred <gap reason="foreign">

St. <hi>Peter</hi> in the Acts of the Apoſtles, does Expound of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> according to that Senſe, the words of Pſalm xv. <hi>Thou wilt not leave my ſoul in hell, nor ſuffer thy holy one to ſee corruption.</hi> Which Paſſage is Literally underſtood of <hi>David,</hi> who ſaid to God that he would not ſuffer his Enemies to take away his Life: and thus the <hi>Hebrew</hi> words <hi>Sceol</hi> and <hi>Scahat,</hi> according to the former Senſe, do ſignifie Liter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally a Sepulchre, and a Ditch. But according to the Spiritual and Myſtical Senſe, which St. <hi>Peter</hi> gives to this Pſalm that he applies to the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> whoſe Type <hi>David</hi> was, the <hi>Greek</hi> words <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap> which he took from the ancient Verſion of the Septuagint, do ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie in the Acts of the Apoſtles, Hell and Corruption. The Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication that the Apoſtle made of the words of that Pſalm, to the Reſurrection of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> does contain nothing but what is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the belief of the <hi>Jews</hi> of that time, who believed the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the dead. They further acknowledged a ſubterranean place, to which Souls do go after their ſeparation from the Body. Without a due regard to all theſe conſiderations, it is impoſſible to underſtand the New Teſtament.</p>
                     <p>Therefore it is to be ſuppoſed as a thing conſtantly agreed upon, that the <hi>Jews,</hi> in the time of our Saviour and the Apoſtles, believed many things, whereof they had no Literal proofs in all the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, being only founded on their Traditions. And the Writings of the Evangeliſts and the Apoſtles, ought to be Expounded with a relation to this <hi>Idea</hi> of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Faith, and not to that which may be conceived of their belief, with a reference to the Books of the Old Teſtament only; becauſe thoſe Books contain but one part of their Religion, the other part being comprehended in their Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The <hi>Jews</hi> do own this Principle. The <hi>Jews,</hi> even the <hi>Caraites,</hi> who do mightily oppoſe the Traditions of the <hi>Talmudiſts,</hi> which had degenerated into Fables, have preſerved thoſe which they believed to be founded on ſufficient Records.</p>
                     <p>The ancient Hereticks, who did not weigh all theſe conſiderations, did rather chooſe to deny the truth of the Books of the New Teſtament, and ſay, that in after times there were interpolations made therein, than to attribute to the Apoſtles ſuch things as they did not underſtand.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:96711:121"/>It is upon this ſuppoſed ground that the <hi>Manichees,</hi> (who found no expreſs Paſſages in the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that made mention of Jeſus Chriſt,) rejected as falſe, all thoſe Places of the <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> that were applied to him in the New Teſtament. They did not conſider that at the time of Chriſt and the Apoſtles, there was a Myſtical and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Senſe approved of by all the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſome <hi>Sadducees</hi> poſſibly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.

                     <p>And therefore they deceive themſelves, who pretend that there ought to be a Literal Senſe in all the Citations of the Apoſtles, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in thoſe which they bring in for Proofs. It is true, that a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of Scripture taken Allegorically, cannot ſerve for a Proof; but we ſpeak here of ſuch Allegorical Senſes as were received, and which were alſo founded on Traditions that were warranted by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. They were therefore permitted to apply them to their Diſcourſe, and likewiſe to draw ſuch Conſequences from them as might promote their deſign, in the ſame manner as the <hi>Phariſees</hi> made uſe of them in their Diſputes againſt the <hi>Sadducees.</hi> Thoſe Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legorical Senſes prove nothing for their own confirmation, but ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a belief already eſtabliſhed, upon which they were founded.</p>
                     <p>It is probable that <hi>Theodore de Mopſueſte,</hi> Expounded the Pſalms and the Propheſies according to this Method, and that he had regard to nothing, when he was condemned as a favourer of the <hi>Jews,</hi> but the Literal and Hiſtorical Senſe, which he gave to thoſe ancient Propheſies. They will not conſider the Application he made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, with the whole Church, to the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> according to a Spiritual and Myſtical Senſe. If we believe <hi>Facundus,</hi> there is no juſtice done to that great Man, who had a perfect knowledge of the Sacred Writings.<note n="(q)" place="bottom">Eum dicunt evacuaſſe omnes in Chriſtum factas Prophetias, quod Manichaeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum erroris eſt. <hi>Fac. pro def. tri. cap.

                        </note> They accuſed him of deſtroying the Propheſies that related to Jeſus Chriſt, by an error like to that of the <hi>Manichees.</hi> But he ſhews the falſhood of this accuſation, by producing the very words of <hi>Theodore,</hi> taken out of his Commentaries upon the Pſalms. <hi>Quod autem</hi> (ſaith <hi>Facundus</hi>) <hi>nec evacuet omnes in Chriſtum prophetias palam eſt quia rurſus in ejuſdem Pſalmi expoſitione dicit, &amp;c.</hi> Whence he concludes,<note n="(r)" place="bottom">Non ergo Theodorus Judaicae impietatis arguendus eſt, tanquam hominem pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taverit Chriſtum, cùm potiùs Judaeos irrideat. <hi>Fac. ibid.</hi>

                        <pb n="58" facs="tcp:96711:122"/>does aſſure us. I have only made mention of the Paſſage that I might ſhew, that great Men have of a long time acknowledged two Senſes of Scripture, as we have already made evident.</p>
                     <p>It is certain that the Chriſtian Religion is founded on that of the <hi>Jews.</hi> The Chriſtians have this in common with them, that they adore the ſame God, and that they believe a <hi>Meſſiah</hi> promiſed in the Writings of the Old Teſtament; which they receive equally. And therefore the Chriſtians who Expound thoſe Writings in a Literal and Hiſtorical Senſe, cannot be blamed, as if they favoured <hi>Judaiſm,</hi> in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of the Chriſtian Religion, ſeeing they acknowledged a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Senſe, called Spiritual and Myſtical, which they apply to the <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> This latter Senſe is the ſame that the <hi>Jews</hi> call <hi>deras.</hi> In a word, it is impoſſible to arrive at a perfect knowledge of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, and the Principles upon which it is eſtabliſhed, ſo long as that of the <hi>Jews</hi> is not known, to which the former does owe its Original.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Celſus, Porphyrius, Julian,</hi> and the <hi>Jews</hi> have brought ſome other Objections againſt the Writings of the Evangeliſts and Apoſtles. The Principal is that which is drawn from the Genealogy of Jeſus Chriſt, Recorded in a different manner by St. <hi>Matthew</hi> and St. <hi>Luke.</hi> They alledge, that beſides that theſe two Evangeliſts do not agree, they have delivered manifeſt falſities. But this aſperſion has been ſo clearly wiped off, by many Commentators upon the New Teſtament, and alſo in the Volumes that purpoſely have been written for that end, that it is needleſs to inſiſt on it. I ſhall only obſerve in general, that it is eaſie to make anſwer to the <hi>Jews,</hi> upon ſuch objections as are drawn from Genealogies. When they bring againſt the Chriſtians, the difference that is betwixt our Evangeliſts and the Books of the Old Teſtament, their Mouths will be ſtopped, if we ſhew them, that there is no leſs in this matter betwixt the Chronicles, which they attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to <hi>Eſdras,</hi> and the reſt of the Hiſtorical Writings of the Old Teſtament. Their Rabbins, who could not reconcile things that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared ſo remote from one another, are forced to own, that the ſame Genealogies, which are written in a different manner, were taken out of Records that did likewiſe differ. And may not we alſo affirm, that the Evangeliſts Collected the Genealogy of Jeſus Chriſt out of ſuch Records as were amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> at that time, but are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant at this day? And therefore it is better to leave the things as they are, than to judg raſhly of them, or correct that Genealogy upon bare conjectures.</p>

It is the common Belief of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that the Books of the Old Teſtament were written by Perſons who were Inſpired: which Belief was tranſmitted from the <hi>Jews</hi> to the Chriſtians.

                     <p>The Chriſtians have alſo extended that Inſpiration to the Books of the New Teſtament. There are but very few Criticks who are of the Opinion, that there is nothing of Inpiration in Scripture, but only in that part of it that was Compoſed by the Prophets. They ſay the Hiſtorical Books were not inſpired, becauſe (as they alledge) it is not neceſſary for him that writes Hiſtory, to be a Prophet. <hi>Grotius</hi> is of that Opinion, in his Book Entituled, <hi>Votum pro pace Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticâ;</hi>

                        </note> if we judge of the Works of the Apoſtles by their Stile, we ſhall find that they writ as particular Doctors, and not as Prophets, becauſe they have nothing that is Prophetical. Which
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:96711:123"/>he does prove by the ſame way of reaſoning, as <hi>Grotius.</hi> It is (ſaith he) the cuſtom of the Prophets, to declare through all their Writings, that they ſpake by God's order; and they have obſerved that, not only in their Prophecies, but in their Letters which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain revelations.</p>
                     <p>This Opinion of <hi>Grotius</hi> and <hi>Spinoſa,</hi> has been lately renewed in two Letters, Publiſhed in a Treatiſe, Entitled, <hi>The Opinions of ſome Divines of</hi> Holland <hi>upon the Critical Hiſtory of the Old Teſtament.</hi> See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I have given a ſufficient Anſwer to thoſe two Letters, and alſo to the new Explications thereof, which have been ſince publiſhed; 'tis to no purpoſe to repeat here what has been ſaid elſewhere: We ſhall only obſerve in general, that thoſe Men do deceive themſelves, whilſt they will not own any Inſpiration, but that of the Prophecies. It is true, that the manner of writing a Hiſtory, and Letters is not the ſame as writing Prophecies; And therefore, theſe words (<hi>The word of God that came to</hi> Luke) do not begin the Hiſtory of St. <hi>Luke</hi> or any other Evangeliſt. The Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> Joſhua, and in a word, all the Hiſtorical Books of the Old Teſtament, are not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in that Stile which <hi>Grotius</hi> does call Prophetical: Yet <hi>Joſephus</hi> and all the Ancient <hi>Jews</hi> call them Prophetical, believing that they were given by Divine Inſpiration.</p>
                     <p>'Tis not neceſſary, for a Book's being inſpired, that it ſhould be indited by God, word for word. The falſe Idea that thoſe Authors have conceived of the Inſpiration of the Sacred Writings, made them embrace an opinion which is contrary to all Antiquity, as well Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daical as Chriſtian. Jeſus Chriſt, who promiſed to his Apoſtles; that the Spirit of God ſhould guide them in all the functions of their Miniſtry, did not therefore, deprive them of their Reaſon and Memory: Although they were inſpired, they continued to be Men ſtill, and managed their Affairs as other Men. I freely own, that there was no need of Inſpiration, to put in record ſuch matters of Fact, whereof they themſelves were Witneſſes. But this does not hinder, but that they were directed by the Spirit of God in all that they put in Writing, ſo as not to fall into error.</p>
                     <p>It is certain, that all the Ancient Eccleſiaſtical Writers did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge this Inſpiration of the Evangeliſts and Apoſtles. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs they ſpeak of their care, and exactneſs in penning their Works, in the ſame manner, as they ſpeak of other Writers, who are not inſpired. Can <hi>Grotius</hi> conclude from thence, that thoſe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Doctors of the Church did not believe, that the Books of the New Teſtament were given by Divine Inſpirations. This he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do, ſeeing thoſe very Doctors have clearly maintained it. We need but call to mind what has been ſaid in the 10th Chap. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:96711:124"/>the Opinion of <hi>Papias,</hi> who was contemporary with the Diſciples of the Apoſtles: He does aſſure us, that if that Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt, did not obſerve in his Hiſtory, the order of things as to their Event, that he was not in the leaſt to be blamed for that; becauſe he made mention of the things according as he remembred them, not being ſo careful to relate them in their order, as he was, to ſay nothing but what was Truth. <hi>Papias,</hi> or rather one of the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the Apoſtles, (whoſe words <hi>Papias</hi> does produce in that place) did not thereby pretend to reject the Inſpiration of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel of St. <hi>Mark.</hi> We need but conſult the other Ancient Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Writers, who expreſſed themſelves in ſuch a manner, as might oblige <hi>Grotius</hi> and <hi>Spinoſa</hi> to believe, that they owned no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration in the Books of the New Teſtament, if they had not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly maintained it in other places of their Works.</p>
                     <p>That which,<note place="margin">II. Epiſt. ad Tim. c. <hi>3.</hi> v. <hi>16.</hi>
                        </note> amongſt Chriſtians does moſt of all confirm the Inſpiration of the Sacred Writings; is the ſtrong Foundation that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> has in one of his Epiſtles to <hi>Timothy, all Scripture is given by Divine Inſpiration.</hi> We have elſewhere refuted all the ſubtil allegations that were brought by <hi>Grotius,</hi> who endeavoured to the utmoſt of his power, to put quite another ſenſe on that Paſſage. But I made it moſt manifeſt, that that able Critick was to be blam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, on many accounts, in attempting to wreſt the interpretation of thoſe words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that he might accommodate them to his own Idea's.</p>
                     <p>It is ſurpriſing, that the Cardinal of <hi>Perron,</hi> who was perſwaded of the Inſpiration of the Holy Scripture, ſhould nevertheleſs have made his ſtrongeſt efforts,<note place="margin">Anſw. to the Def. of ſome <hi>Holl.</hi> Div. c. 10.</note> for depriving Chriſtians of this proof of Inſpiration. It is cuſtomary amongſt thoſe who write Books of Controverſie, to think of nothing, but anſwering the Objections of their Adverſaries, without examining the proper and natural ſenſe of the Paſſages of Scripture, for the confirmation of their own Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. He followed this Method of Polemical Authors, in his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the <hi>King</hi> of Great Britain: Seeing the Proteſtants forget nothing, that may recommend the Authority of the Scripture alone, without the aid of Traditions,<note place="margin">II.

The Proteſtants did object to him thoſe words of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, All Scripture is given by Divine Inſpiration, and it profitable for Doctriue.</hi> Thus in effect, that place of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy</hi> ought to be rendred; nevertheleſs he does loudly oppoſe this Tranſlation,<note place="margin">Du Perr. lib. <hi>3.</hi> de Trad.

                     <p>To what purpoſe are all thoſe niceties of Grammar and Dialect, which the Cardinal does uſe in that place? It is true, that he does alledge the Authority of St. <hi>John Chryſoſtome, Theodoret</hi> and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fathers, for the confirmation of his Opinion. But I deſire no other teſtimony but theirs, to bring it under condemnation: And to avoid being tedious, in a thing ſo eaſie to be juſtified, ſeeing the Works of thoſe Fathers are every where to be had, it will ſuffice, if we inform our ſelves of St. <hi>Jerome</hi>'s thoughts in the caſe; he is of a quite different Opinion from that which the Cardinal has Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd on him. That Learned Biſhop does not ſay, with the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, that that Paſſage ought to be underſtood, <hi>diſtributively,</hi> by tranſlating it, <hi>all Scripture,</hi> and not <hi>collectively,</hi> by tranſlating it, <hi>all the Scripture:</hi> He does on the contrary, aſſure us in his Homily,<note place="margin">Chryſoſt.

                        </gap>. But by the Scripture that is ſpoken of in that place, it is evident that we muſt underſtand all the Old Teſtament.</p>
                     <p>It is in no wiſe likely, that <hi>du Perron</hi> himſelf had read St. <hi>John Chryſoſtome</hi>'s Homily, or any other of the <hi>Greek</hi> Fathers whom he cites. That which deceived thoſe who read them for him, and gave him an abſtract of their pretended ſentiments, is, that they conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only the Latin Verſion of that Homily, where it is, according to the vulgar Tranſlation, <hi>Omnis Scriptura divinitùs inſpirata eſt utilis,</hi> i. e. <hi>All Scripture that is given by the Inſpiration of God is profitable.</hi> But it was ſhewn elſewhere, that in the ancient vulgar, it was <hi>Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rata &amp; utilis</hi> i. e. <hi>is inſpired and profitable;</hi> as it is in the <hi>Greek,</hi> and that we are to expound that Paſſage <hi>collectively</hi> and not <hi>diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We may nevertheleſs, very well give that ſenſe alſo to the vulgar, as the rendition is at this day; according to that reading the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation will be, <hi>All the Scripture which was given by Inſpiration is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable,</hi> and not with <hi>Amelote,</hi> and with the Authors of the <hi>Mons</hi> Tranſlation, <hi>All Scripture that has been given by Divine Inſpiration, is profitable.</hi> The <hi>Syriack, Arabick,</hi> and <hi>Ethiopick</hi> Verſions, which that Cardinal pretends to be favourable to him, have quite another ſenſe than what he does attribute to them, as I have ſhewn, in <hi>the Anſwer to the Defence of the Opinions of ſome</hi> Holland <hi>Divines,</hi>

This Opinion is very little agreeable to the Doctrin of the Ancient Eccleſiaſtical Writers, who ſeemed not to have ſtretched that Inſpiration beyond the things themſelves. But <hi>Eſtius,</hi> who taught Theology in the Univerſity of <hi>Douay,</hi> was obliged to ſpeak the Language of the Divines of that place, who had made a Decree, upon that matter, againſt the Fathers, the Jeſuits of <hi>Louvain,</hi> who had ſet out ſome propoſitions directly oppoſite thereunto.

                     <p>It is not of late, that the Divines, who make profeſſion of fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in their Schools and Books, have oppoſed the Theology of the Fathers the Jeſuits. Thoſe Fathers having an 1586. maintained in their Colledge of <hi>Louvain</hi> ſome Propoſitions upon
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:96711:125"/>the Subject of Grace, Predeſtination and the Holy Scripture, which appeared new to the Doctors of <hi>Louvain</hi> and <hi>Douay;</hi> theſe Doctors did cenſure them, and withal publiſhed the reaſons of their cenſure: Seeing we do not ſpeak in this place, of Grace and Predeſtination, but only of the Holy Scripture, I ſhall inſiſt on ſuch things only as concern the Scripture. You may take a view of the Title of the Cenſure iſſued out by the Divines of <hi>Louvain,</hi> as it was Printed at Paris, at the end of a Book entitled, <hi>Florentii Conrii Peregrinus Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richuntinus, Cenſura Facultatum Sacrae Theologiae Lovanienſis ac Dua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſis ſuper quibuſdam Articulis de Sacrâ Scripturâ,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>anno Domini</hi> 1586. <hi>Scripto traditis.</hi> The Cenſure is directed to all the Body of the Jeſuits of <hi>Louvain,</hi> in theſe Terms; <hi>Reverendis in Chriſto Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, Patri Rectori ac Profeſſoribus caeteriſque Patribus Collegii Societatis no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis Jeſu in Univerſitate Lovanienſi, Decanus &amp; reliqui Facultatis in eâdem <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſitate Magiſtri, aeternam ſalutem pacemque precamur.</hi>

                     <p>Theſe three Propoſitions were extracted out of the Writings of the Fathers the Jeſuits, who taught Theology in the College of <hi>Louvain;</hi> and they were ſo far from condemning them, upon a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance made to them, that they were ſcandalous, that they free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defended them, adding thereunto new explications: <hi>ab iiſdem ibidem Profeſſoribus pro ſuis agnitae, comprobatae, ſcholiiſque illuſtratae.</hi> They appeared to be really agreeable to good ſenſe, neither do they much vary from the Theology of the Ancient Fathers, whom we are
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:96711:126"/>more bound to hear, upon this Subject, than the <hi>Sacred Faculty of Theology of</hi> Louvain; who, in condemning them as they did, were guilty of a great act of injuſtice againſt the Society of the Jeſuits: The words of the Cenſure, as to their purport, are<note n="(h)" place="bottom">Tres illae aſſertiones accedere videntur ad damnatam olim Anomaeorum opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nionem, qui Prophetas &amp; Apoſtolos in multis volebant ut homines fuiſſe locutos, ut refert Epiphanius, Haereſi <hi>76.</hi> &amp; ad eorum ſententiam quam praefatione in Epiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam ad Philemonem &amp; alibi Hieronymus reprehendit, de quâ &amp; notatus Eraſmus fuit. <hi>Cenſ.

                     <p>Before we enter upon a diſcuſſion of what concerns the Divines of <hi>Louvain,</hi> we ſhall relate the Cenſure of the Faculty of Theology of <hi>Douay.</hi> Theſe Divines declare, that they have examined the Propoſitions of the Jeſuits, by the Order of the Archbiſhops of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bray</hi> and of <hi>Malines,</hi> and of the Biſhop of <hi>Gand:</hi> They do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn them in groſs, as the Doctors of <hi>Louvain</hi> had done, but they apply their Cenſure to each Propoſition in particular. To the two firſt they oppoſe St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> who did (according to their Opinion) believe, that the Sacred Writers received from God, a <hi>partioular fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty and method of delivering and compoſing their diſcourſe.</hi> They do alſo quote <hi>Gabriel</hi> a Scholaſtick Divine; who affirmed, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were Inſpired with many natural Truths, and that a Book might be inſpired, although there be pains and meditation uſed in its compoſure. Thoſe Divines do likewiſe give for an Example, Jeſus Chriſt,<note n="(i)" place="bottom">Si ſcribere voluiſſet, laborem nonnunquam &amp; meditationem ſimulque indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriam aliquam adhibere potuit humanam, quamvis interim ſpiritus ejus humanus, itemque os, lingua, manus, digiti perpetua quaedam eſſent inſtrumenta Divini Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritûs. <hi>Cenſ.

And thus the Doctors of <hi>Douay</hi> do endeavour to deſtroy the Propoſitions
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:96711:126"/>of the Jeſuits of <hi>Louvain,</hi> which to them appeared to be ſcandalous: And alſo under a pretence of ſhewing, that they ſubvert all Religion, in ſpeaking to the ſecond Propoſition, they add, that<note n="(k)" place="bottom">Si non eſt neceſſarium ut ſingulae veritates &amp; ſententiae quae ſunt in Sacris Literis immediatè ſint à Spiritu Sancto ipſi ſcriptori inſpiratae, non modò ſequetur indeterminabilis altercatio ſuper ſententiis immediatè vel non immediatè inſpiratis, verùm etiam de integris Evangeliis, quorum hiſtoria potuit humanitùs eſſe nota; imò &amp; de omnibus Scripturis non Propheticis dubitabitur, an immediate Spiritus Sanctus eas ſcriptoribus inſpiraverit. <hi>Theol.

                     <p>The third Propoſition appeared to thoſe Divines, to be the moſt dangerous of all, and oppoſite to the words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who does aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure us, that all the Scripture is given by the Inſpiration of God, and a Divine Doctrin, which was indited by the Holy Spirit. It is for this Reaſon, (ſay they) that the Decrees of Popes and of Councils, were never reckoned in the number of Divine Writings; although the Holy Ghoſt does teſtifie by the Church, that there is nothing that is falſe in thoſe Decrees. And finally they add, that that third Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Jeſuits of <hi>Louvain</hi> could not be maintained, without acknowledging, that the Hiſtories of <hi>Thucydides,</hi> and of <hi>Livie,</hi> might for the ſame reaſon be reckoned amongſt the Books of the Scripture; if the Holy Ghoſt ſhould teſtifie to us, that there is nothing of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhood in thoſe Hiſtories. They conclude their Cenſure with this Maxim:<note n="(l)" place="bottom">Non enim ideò inſpiratum aliquid divinitùs eſt quòd poſteà ſit approbatum; ſed ideò eſt approbatum, quia fuerat divinitùs inſpiratum. <hi>ibid.</hi>

Let us now ſee, if the Doctors of the two Faculties of Theology had reaſon to condemn thoſe three Propoſitions, in terms that are inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to the Society of the Jeſuits.</p>
                     <p>'Tis obſervable, that before all theſe things, the Jeſuits, who pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed at <hi>Rome,</hi> an. 1586. a Directory for the Studies of their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, Entitled, <hi>Ratio Studiorum,</hi> have placed this Propoſition con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Inſpiration of the Sacred Writings, amongſt thoſe which

                        <hi>It is more probable</hi> (ſay they) <hi>that the firſt and Original Copies, which were not corrupted, were all particularly indited by the Holy Ghoſt, as to what concerns the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, but in a different manner according to the different condition of the Inſtruments.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By that we ſee, that the Jeſuits of <hi>Rome</hi> did not believe at that time, that the ſame Inſpiration is to be acknowledged in all the Books of the Scripture; and when they ſay, that every word was In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired, they add withal, <hi>as to what concerns the Subſtance.</hi> Beſides, they do not maintain this Inſpiration of words, as to what belongs to the ſubſtance, but as a probable Opinion; ſo that they believe, that that may be alſo denied with probability. It is true, that the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of thoſe two Faculties of Theology, belonging to <hi>Louvain</hi> and <hi>Douay,</hi> was then moſt received in the Schools. But the Jeſuits, who from that time, have had Learned Men in their Society, ſaw very well, that it was contradictory to good ſenſe; and likewiſe oppoſite to the moſt Ancient Doctors of the Church. Thoſe of their Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of <hi>Louvain,</hi> did nothing that was contrary to the Rule or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of their Foundation; which<note n="(n)" place="bottom">Fundator conſtitutionum, <hi>3.</hi> part. c. <hi>10.</hi> diſertis verbis cavet ne novae opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ones admittantur.

                     <p>There is nothing more judicious, than the Liberty of Opinion, which is granted by the Conſtitutions of that Society to its Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, in the manner as it is limited.<note n="(o)" place="bottom">Sequantur, ait Ignatius, in quavis facultate ſecuriorem &amp; magis approbatam doctrinam, &amp; eos auctores qui eam docent.

                        </note> Father <hi>Ignatius</hi> did ordain, that in every Science whatſoever, they ſhould follow the moſt certain and the moſt received Doctrine.

                     <p>And the truth is, the Jeſuits did no ſooner appear in the World,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:96711:127"/>but there was a birth given to much more conſiderable aſſiſtances, for the ſtudy of Theology, than had ever been before that time. And therefore they did wiſely, that they were not altogether devoted to the Opinions of St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> and St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> though they were zealouſly embraced in the moſt part of the Univerſities at that time. They had reaſon in that caſe, not to follow blindly the Opinions that were moſt received in the Schools in their time, concerning the Inſpiration of the Sacred Writings. This liberty of Propheſie, which had been agreed upon, in behalf of their Profeſſors of Theology, did afford them an occaſion of making new diſcoveries in this Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: and to this I impute the rigor with which the Jeſuits of <hi>Louvain</hi> maintain their Opinions about Inſpiration, without troubling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves about the Belief of the two Faculties of Theology of <hi>Louvain</hi> and <hi>Douay,</hi> who had not carefully enough examined that matter.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding the Cenſures of thoſe two Faculties, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to teach, in their College of <hi>Louvain,</hi> the ſame Opinions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Inſpiration of the Sacred Writings. Father <hi>Cornelius à Lapide,</hi> a few years after that time, kept up, in the ſame place, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Lectures on the Holy Scriptures; which he continued for the ſpace of ſixteen years. He likewiſe publiſhed thoſe Lectures by the Order of the Archbiſhop of <hi>Malines,</hi> and of his Superiors, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in his Commentaries with the Epiſtles of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> which he did Dedicate to the Archbiſhop. But in the Expoſition which he gives of the Paſſage of that Apoſtle, where he ſpeaks of the Scriptures being given by the Inſpiration of God, he is altogether againſt <hi>Eſtius,</hi> who was at the ſame time Profeſſor in the Univerſity of <hi>Douay.</hi> It is manifeſt, that that Jeſuit did inſiſt on that difficulty on purpoſe, and that he then had an Eye to the Cenſures of the Divines of <hi>Louvain</hi> and <hi>Douay.</hi> He maintained in his Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries upon that place of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> the Propoſitions which his Doctors had condemned.</p>
                     <p>Although the Commentaries of <hi>Cornelius à Lapide</hi> may be had eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where, it is convenient to ſet down his own words in this place, by which we may perceive that the Jeſuits of <hi>Louvain</hi> did not regard the Cenſures of the Divines there.<note n="(p)" place="bottom">Nota Spiritum Sanctum non eodem modo dictaſſe omnes Sacras Literas.

So that the Holy Spirit did not ſuggeſt to them either their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, or the remembrance of thoſe things which they knew; but did In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire them in this reſpect only, that they might put one conception in writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, rather than another.</hi> In this, the Inſpiration of the Hiſtorical, and Moral Writings of the Holy Scripture did conſiſt, according to the Opinion of that learned Jeſuit; wherein nothing appears but what is good Senſe; whereas in the Opinion of the Doctors of <hi>Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vain</hi> and <hi>Douay,</hi> (which is the ſame with that of the <hi>Calviniſts</hi>) there is ſomething unintelligible, that does violence both to Reaſon and Experience.</p>
                     <p>It cannot be ſaid that this Opinion is a Novelty that was unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſedly aſſerted by that Jeſuit.

A very free Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of a Learned Divine of <hi>Paris</hi> about the ſame thing.</head>
                     <p>SEeing I have no other publick Records of the Fathers the Jeſuits of <hi>Louvain,</hi> to juſtifie their Propoſitions concerning the Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Scripture, than what I have already mentioned, I ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſupply that defect, by examining the Reaſons of the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the two Faculties of Theology of <hi>Louvain</hi> and of <hi>Douay.</hi> I am willing to believe that thoſe Divines had no other deſign therein, but what was for the Defence of the Truth, or rather their own old Opinions, and that Paſſion had no part in all that Diſpute. As to what concerns the Jeſuits, it is probable, that they had not intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced that Opinion into the Colledges of <hi>Flanders,</hi> but in confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the Liberty which had been granted to their Profeſſors, not to ingage themſelves eaſily in the maintainance of any Opinions, how old ſoever, when they did not appear to be warrantable. In a
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:96711:129"/>word, the Jeſuits make no profeſſion of ſubmitting to the deciſions of a Maſter, as a Rule <hi>from which there is no Appeal, non jurant in verba Magiſtri.</hi> And ſeeing there is nothing in that conduct, but what does become wiſe Men, they are much to be blamed who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe them for oppoſing the Opinions that are received and authoriſed in the moſt part of the Schools; when thoſe Opinions have no good Foundation: which happened to them in the matter which we now handle.</p>
                     <p>The Divines of <hi>Louvain</hi> bring for one of the principal motives of their Cenſure, the conformity that the three Propoſitions of the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits have to an old Opinion that was condemned in the <hi>Anomeans,</hi> whereof St. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> all through makes mention. But to ſhew the falſhood of this objection, it will be ſufficient to bring the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of <hi>Epiphanius.</hi> That Father does ſay, that the <hi>Anomeans</hi>

Haer. 76. n. 6.</note> tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the Prophets and the Evangeliſts: that when they were much urged, they avoided the difficulty by anſwering, that the Apoſtle ſpake as a Man. Is there any thing in thoſe three Propoſitions above mentioned that comes near this? Did the Jeſuits of the College of <hi>Louvain</hi> alledge, that there might poſſibly be ſomthing that is falſe in the Writings of the Apoſtles, under the pretext that they were Men that ſpake it? Yet that is the Opinion of the <hi>Anomeans,</hi> who being unable to ſatisfie the Reaſons that were brought againſt them, out of the Books of the New Teſtament, ſaid that the Authors of thoſe Books had ſpoken as Men in thoſe places.</p>
                     <p>We ſhall apply the ſame Anſwer to another Objection which thoſe Doctors did take from the Preface of St. <hi>Jerom</hi>'s Commentaries upon the Epiſtle of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Philemon.</hi> That Father does, in that place, make mention of certain Hereticks who rejected that Epiſtle, becauſe they alledged that that Holy Apoſtle was not guided by the Spirit of God in writing it.<note place="margin">Hieron. prooem. Comm. in Epiſt. ad Philem.</note> 
                        <hi>Thoſe who will not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Epiſtle written to</hi> Philemon, <hi>as one of the Epiſtles of</hi> Paul, do ſay, <hi>that the Apoſtle did not ſpeak always, nor all things, by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate aſſiſtance of Chriſt ſpeaking in him; becauſe human frailty could not ſuffer one conſtant tenor of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> But if it ſhould be granted to thoſe Hereticks, that St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and the reſt of the Apoſtles were not Inſpired in all that they writ, it does not therefore follow, that we ought to reject a part of their Writings. It is ſufficient, that we own with the Jeſuits, that there is nothing but Truth in thoſe very places which were not Inſpired, and that the Holy Ghoſt had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them to us as ſuch.</p>

                        </note> if St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſtood in need of any Inſpiration to ſay; <hi>When thou doeſt come, bring my Cloak which I left at</hi> Troas <hi>with</hi> Carpus, <hi>and eſpecially the parchments;</hi> and many other things of that nature. I do declare, that it was in no ways neceſſary that God ſhould Indite ſuch kind of things to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and other Holy Writers. This is the Opinion of the Jeſuits of <hi>Louvain,</hi> which was afterwards confirmed in the ſame place by <hi>Cornelius à Lapide,</hi> whoſe words I have already mentioned. But they did not conclude from thence, that we are not obliged to receive the Books of Scripture, in any parts or places thereof, but thoſe only that were Indited by the Holy Ghoſt. It is ſufficient that they were perſuaded that the Holy Writers were guided by the Spirit of God in every part of their Writings, ſo as not to fall into any error.</p>
                     <p>The Divines of <hi>Louvain</hi> further objected againſt the Jeſuits, that they had renewed an Opinion, which had been condemned in the Perſon of <hi>Eraſmus.</hi> But it is eaſie to make it appear, that thoſe Fathers maintained nothing that had affinity to the Propoſition which <hi>Eraſmus</hi> owned.

                           </gap>.</note> ſome errors in the Writing of the Apoſtles; which were to be attributed to a defect of their Memory. We ſhall find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like this in the three Propoſitions of the Jeſuits of <hi>Louvain,</hi> for although they be very well ſatisfied, that there was no need of any Inſpiration for Writing thoſe things that they knew, they do not upon that account imagin that the Writers were at any time miſtaken through a defect of Memory. <hi>Eraſmus</hi> alſo uſed his utmoſt endeavour in one of his Apologies, to wipe off that accuſation. He does proteſt, that he only reported that which St. <hi>Jerom</hi> had obſerved upon the matter, and that there had been nothing ſaid, but what was agreeable to St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>'s Opinion. Howſoever it is, that Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick does aſſure us,<note n="(b)" place="bottom">Nunc teſtor me abhorrere ab ullâ oblivione tribuendâ Apoſtolis. <hi>Eraſm. Apol. adv. Monach. quoſd.

                        </note> that he never intended to charge the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles with any defect of Memory. I do not inquire if <hi>Eraſmus</hi> was wronged in this. It is enough that I have ſhewn the Propoſition, that is ſuppoſed to have been condemned on his account, and have withal made it appear, that there is nothing of that nature contained in the three Propoſitions of the Jeſuits that were Cenſured.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe very Divines did alſo by way of Objection, bring the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Council of Trent, Seſſ. IV. the words of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> Epiſt. II. ch. 1. v. 21. and thoſe of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Epiſt. II. to <hi>Timothy,</hi> ch. 3. v. 16. But there is nothing in all thoſe places to which the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:96711:130"/>Jeſuits of <hi>Louvain</hi> do not agree. The ſtrongeſt Paſſage is that of the Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and yet it is the ſame, upon which <hi>Cornelius à Lapide</hi> made Obſervations, as I have ſhewn. As to the Teſtimony of the ancient Fathers, who ſaid, that the Tongue, and the Hand of the Holy, were the Holy Ghoſts Pen, the Jeſuits do not deny it. The ſame <hi>Cornelius à Lapide</hi> has explained it at large, in his Commentary upon the ſecond Epiſtle of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> where he makes it appear that it is not contrary to his Opinion about the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration of Scripture. And the truth is, we cannot imagin that the Holy Ghoſt deprived the Evangeliſts and the Apoſtles of the uſe of their Reaſon and Memory.</p>
                     <p>The Reaſons of the Doctors of the Faculty of Theology of <hi>Douay</hi> are no more Concluſive than thoſe of the Divines of <hi>Louvain.</hi> They chiefly depend upon ſome Paſſages of St. <hi>Auguſtin.</hi> But ſince there is nothing that is poſitive in all thoſe Paſſages, it will not be worth the while to inſiſt on them. They bring for example, by way of. Objection, ſome places of his Books <hi>Concerning the conſent of the Evangeliſts.</hi> Yet there is no Work, where that Father has more ſhewn than in that Treatiſe, that the Sacred Writers made uſe of their Reaſon and Memory, when they writ their Goſpels. That Work has alſo given occaſion to <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> and ſome other Writers to affirm that the Memory of the Apoſtles was not always ſure, and that they put ſometimes one word for another.</p>
                     <p>It is true, that St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> is withal of the Opinion, that that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in the Apoſtles was guided by the Holy Ghoſt. But I think it had been much better not to make them fall into error, than to maintain afterwards with that Father, that they would not ſo much as amend the faults of that Nature, after they had acknowledged them, upon a Pretext that they were perſuaded they had done every thing relating thereunto, by the Spirit of God directing their thoughts. <hi>Eraſmus</hi> had alſo recourſe in one of his Apologies to this Anſwer of St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> ſeeing he could not deny that he had charged the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts with a defect of Memory, which was the occaſion that they put the name of one Prophet for another; he endeavours to get off by anſwering, That<note n="(c)" place="bottom">

                        </note> when Memory and Forgetfulneſs are equally governed by the Holy Ghoſt, Forgetfulneſs is then as uſeful as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory. <hi>Maldonat,</hi> who attributes this Opinion to St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> and <hi>Beda,</hi> had reaſon to reject it; and indeed it is not to be maintained. Nor can we find any thing in the Propoſitions of the Jeſuits of <hi>Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vain</hi> that has any affinity with it.</p>
                     <pb n="75" facs="tcp:96711:130"/>
                     <p>That which the Divines of <hi>Douay</hi> borrowed of <hi>Gabriel,</hi> for ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that many Natural Truths were diſcovered to the Apoſtles by Inſpiration, and that we may very well reconcile Inſpiration to the Labour and Meditation of the Sacred Writers, would be agreeable to good Senſe, if by that Inſpiration we underſtand a ſingle direction of the Spirit of God, that kept the Apoſtles from falling into any error. If it be meant on the contrary, that the Holy Spirit did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite the matters of Fact, of which they had been Witneſſes, that cannot be maintained, as <hi>Cornelius à Lapide</hi> has obſerved. Nor is their Opinion eſtabliſhed by the example which they bring of Jeſus Chriſt, who could (ſay they) uſe ſuch Meditation and Application that is ordinary amongſt other Men, if he had Compoſed any Books; for this proves nothing, becauſe if it be ſuppoſed that he had written Books treating of ſuch things as he had ſeen with his Eyes, we will always maintain, that it was not neceſſary that he ſhould be the Inſtrument of the Holy Ghoſt for Writing things of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. This example does moreover appear to be ſomwhat Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical, and can only be reliſhed by thoſe who are accuſtomed to the ſubtilties of the School.</p>
                     <p>To that which they object, That all the Truths of the Scripture ought to be immediately Inſpired; that otherwiſe, there will be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Diſputes about what is, and what is not immediately Inſpired: I anſwer, that it is eaſie to diſtinguiſh theſe two ſorts of Inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, according to the Principles of the Jeſuit <hi>à Lapide.</hi> He does ſuppoſe with good Reaſon, that in Hiſtories of things which were ſeen and heard, and in the Exhortations that concern Morality, there is no need for any immediate Inſpiration, becauſe there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is Prophetical therein.</p>
                     <p>But we may (ſay they) according to this Principle, doubt of all thoſe Writings that are not Prophetical, as the Goſpels, for example, if they were immediately Inſpired. I affirm, on the contrary that there is no ground for any doubt here. For the ſame Jeſuit has clearly ſhewn, by the words of St. <hi>John,</hi> and of St. <hi>Luke,</hi> that an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Inſpiration was not neceſſary for Writing of Hiſtories. The Evangeliſts writ that which they had ſeen, or that which they learned upon certain grounds.</p>
                     <p>And upon this account, <hi>Maldonat</hi> explaining theſe words of Jeſus Chriſt, Matth. xxvi. 28. <hi>This is my blood of the New Teſtament,</hi> and comparing them with theſe words of St. <hi>Luke,</hi>

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:96711:131"/>
                        <hi>Matthaeus qui aderat.</hi> Whence he does conclude, that ſeeing Jeſus Chriſt expreſſed himſelf only in one manner, it is<note n="(d)" place="bottom">Credendum igitur eſt verbis potiùs Matthaei &amp; Marci, quàm Lueae &amp; Pauli Chriſtum uſum fuiſſe. <hi>Mald.

                        </note> better to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve St. <hi>Matthew</hi> who was an Eye Witneſs, and who was followed by St. <hi>Mark,</hi> than St. <hi>Luke</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who were not preſent at the Action. It is eaſie to judg, that in that place <hi>Maldonat</hi> had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to Inſpiration, ſince he affirms that St. <hi>Matthew</hi> had barely reported that which he had ſeen.</p>
                     <p>Yet for all this, I do not believe, that the Proof which that Jeſuit does uſe againſt the Proteſtants, is altogether Concluſive. For it is to be ſuppoſed, that the manner wherein the Evangeliſts expreſs the ſame thing, does wholly proceed from themſelves. It is ſufficient that they all agree in the ſubſtance of the things, whilſt it is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that they ſhould joyn in the Expreſſions. Every one of them might chooſe his own Words according to his pleaſure. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it cannot be neceſſarily inferred from <hi>Maldonat</hi>'s Reaſoning, that Jeſus Chriſt did rather ſay that which was mentioned by St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> than that which is Recorded by St. <hi>Luke,</hi> and by St. <hi>Paul.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Divines of <hi>Douay</hi> do inſiſt yet more vigorouſly on the third Propoſition of the Jeſuits of <hi>Louvain,</hi> than upon the two others. This laſt Propoſition does contain (as they think) a manifeſt error, <hi>manifeſti erroris periculum continens;</hi> for it does Authoriſe ſuch Books for Divine and Canonical, as have been written by Men without any aſſiſtance of the Holy Spirit, <hi>humanâ induſtriâ, ſine aſſiſtentiâ Spiruûs Sancti.</hi> It cannot be denied but that the Jeſuits ſet out this Propoſition, which ſeems to be much like the Opinion of <hi>Grotius</hi> and <hi>Spinoſa:</hi> but they add withal, that it is ſufficient that the Holy Spirit does aſſure us, that there is nothing but Truth in thoſe Writings. <hi>Si Spinitus Sanctus poſtea teſtetur ibi nihil eſſe falſum, effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur Scriptura.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We may by the ſame Reaſon (ſay the Doctors of <hi>Douay</hi>) call the Decrees of Popes and Councils Holy Scripture, becauſe we are alſo aſſured that there is no falſhood in thoſe Decrees. We may alſo place <hi>Livy,</hi> and <hi>Thucydides</hi> in the number of the Holy Writings, if the Holy Ghoſt teſtifie that they contain nothing that is falſe. But this Conſequence does not at all follow from the third Propoſition of the Jeſuits of <hi>Louvain.</hi> For they Suppoſe that the Holy Ghoſt does pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe thoſe Books to us as Canonical, to be for a Rule in Religion. The Decrees of Councils, and of Popes, have no ſuch thing in them; if it were ſo, they would not be any longer conſidered as
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:96711:131"/>bare Decrees of the Church, but as works that had been to the ſame Church, to ſerve for a Rule as well in Faith as in Manners. The Example of the Hiſtories of <hi>Thucydides</hi> and of <hi>Livy,</hi> which they bring, is nothing to the purpoſe; for thoſe Authors have not written of things that concern our Salvation.</p>
                     <p>As to the Maxim of thoſe Divines, <hi>That a thing is not Inſpired, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was afterwards approved, but that, on the contrary it is approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe it was Inſpired,</hi> it does not contradict the Propoſition of the Jeſuits; who continually ſuppoſe, that the Books we chiefly treat of, have the teſtimony of the Holy Ghoſt, although they had not been immediatly Inſpired; which may ſuffice to render them ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved. The truth is, many Learned Divines believed, that it was not neceſſary, that God ſhould Inſpire <hi>Moſes</hi> with a knowledge of every thing that he has written in <hi>Geneſis,</hi> concerning the Creation of the World, and the Genealogies of the Ancient Patriarchs. He could be furniſhed (as they judged) with ſufficient light about thoſe things, by what he learned of his Anceſtors, who had kept Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs of the ſame. <hi>Doctus &amp; eruditus</hi> (ſaith the Jeſuit <hi>Pererius</hi>) <hi>à Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joribus ſuis,</hi>

And therefore, I am ſo far from accuſing the Propoſitions of the Jeſuits of <hi>Louvain</hi> as erroneous, that I find nothing to be contained therein, but what is agreeable to Truth and good Senſe. The Doctors who oppoſed them with ſo great heat, had never exerciſed their thoughts ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon Queſtions of that nature: They followed the old Opinion of their own Schools; and ſeeing they only conſulted their own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices, they condemned that with a great deal of precipitation, which they did not altogether underſtand.</p>

But (ſaith that Author) the things that are contained in Scripture are not all reveal'd: From this Principle, (which he does illuſtrate by ſome Examples) he draws this Conſequence, that we may in ſome manner, excuſe ſome very Learned Catholick Divines, who imputed to the Evangeliſts, a few faults which proceeded from a defect of their memory, as in putting one name for another, in diſagreeing amongſt themſelves about the time, or any other circumſtances of the actions which they relate, provided that it falls not upon the ſubſtance, and upon the things themſelves:<note n="(g)" place="bottom">Tales enim lapſus extra ſubſtantiam facti nihil fidei obſunt aut obeſſe poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunt, neque ſunt circa aliquid fide divinâ credendum, ſed circa id quod ſolam hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manam ſenſatam ſecum fert notitiam.

                     <p>Yet although <hi>de Dominis</hi> does explain this opinion at good length, he declares, that he dares not proſecute the ſame to the full. He avows, that there are many places in the Bible, in which it ſeems that the Writers are miſtaken; that the ſolutions that are given for removing difficulties of that nature, are very much conſtrained, with which pious Souls ought nevertheleſs to be content, although they do not ſatisfie thoſe who ſeverely examin every thing.<note n="(h)" place="bottom">Ego ſanè quod in me eſt rigorem depono, &amp; malo cum difficultate piam amplecti interpretationem, quàm lapſum etiam iſtum levem &amp; circa ſolas circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantias admittere. <hi>Ibid.</hi>
                        </note> He does chooſe rather to take the part of thoſe who are far from rigour, than charge the Holy Writers with the leaſt fault, even in the things of ſmall importance. But after all, he does not diſapprove the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Catholick Doctors, who alledged miſtakes of that kind, which are not prejudicial to our Faith: There is nothing that does more diminiſh the Authority of the Holy Scripture, even in things Eſſential and Revealed, than conſtrained Anſwers, that provoke laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in thoſe, who are not of the ſame belief with us: By this we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that the Archbiſhop of <hi>Spalatro</hi> was in a ſtrait, whoſe part he was to take, about a Queſtion of this delicacy.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XXV. Spinoſa</hi>'s Objections againſt the Inſpiration of the Books of the New Teſtament are Examined.</head>
                     <p>ALthough <hi>Spinoſa</hi> had very little or no knowledge of the Books of the New Teſtament, yet he would by all means, inſert in his Treatiſe Entitled <hi>Theologico-politicus,</hi> a whole Chapter againſt the Inſpiration of thoſe Books; where he only gives a greater light to that which <hi>Grotius</hi> had formerly written upon this matter, in many places of his Works. His great Principle is,<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Apoſtoli non tanquàm Prophetae, ſed tanquam Doctores ſcripſerunt, &amp; viam ad docendum elegerunt quam faciliorem judicaverunt fore diſcipulis quos tum docere volebant. <hi>Spin. Tract. Theol. polit. cap. 12.</hi>
                        </note> that the Apoſtles did not write as Prophets, but as ſingle Doctors; and that therefore it was not neceſſary that they ſhould be Inſpired. But this diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betwixt Prophets and Doctors, does not at all deſtroy that Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which is attributed to the Apoſtles; which does only conſiſt in a bare direction of the Spirit of God, as has been ſhewn be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                     <p>God (ſay they) did not command them to write, as he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Prophets to publiſh their Prophecies: We have alſo obſerved from the beginning of this Work, that, when the Ancient Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Writers ſpeak of the Goſpels, they declare, that they were compoſed only occaſionally, and at the requeſt of the firſt Believers. It does not indeed ſo evidently appear to us, that the Evangeliſts and Apoſtles had an expreſs Commandment of God, or even of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, to publiſh Books for the Inſtruction of the firſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, as it does appear, that the Prophets did ſpeak to the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> by Gods Order. But we ſee, that Jeſus Chriſt commanded his Diſciples to go and Preach the Goſpel, to all Nations of the Earth: But their Hiſtories, which we call Goſpels, are nothing elſe but Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections of their Sermons, which were animated by the Spirit of God, whom their Maſter had promiſed to them.</p>
                     <p>The Prophets (<hi>Spinoſa</hi> continues,) do not only obſerve in their Prophecies, but alſo in their Letters, that it was God who ſpake by their Mouth; which he proves by the Letter that the Prophet <hi>Elias</hi> writ to King <hi>Joram,</hi> and is mentioned 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> Ch. 21. v. 12. Which
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:96711:133"/>begins with theſe words, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord,</hi>
                        <note n="(b)" place="bottom">In Epiſtolis Apoſtolorum nihil ſimile legimus, ſed contra in I. ad Cor. <hi>7.40.</hi> Paulus ſecundùm ſuam ſententiam loquitur. <hi>Spin. ibid. cap. 11.</hi>
                        </note> we read no ſuch thing, (ſaith he) in the Letters of the Apoſtles. St. <hi>Paul</hi> on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, ſpeaks as from himſelf, in his firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> Chap. 7. v. 40.</p>
                     <p>If the Stile of the Apoſtles be not altogether the ſame as that of the Prophets; it cannot from thence be concluded, that the former were not guided by the Spirit of God, in all the actions of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery. It was in no wiſe neceſſary, that they ſhould repeat in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diſcourſe, that it was the Lord who ſpake. It was ſufficient, for them to declare in general, that Jeſus Chriſt had ſent them to Preach the Truths of the Goſpel, and that he, who had given them that Miſſion in his Father's Name, had told them expreſly, <hi>It is not you that ſpeak, but the Spirit of your Heavenly Father who ſpeaks in you.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is true, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> does ſpeak as from himſelf, in the firſt Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to the <hi>Corinth.</hi> Chap. 7. where he makes uſe of this Expreſſion; <hi>I give my judgment,</hi>

                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> The ground of <hi>Spinoſa</hi>'s error was, that a Man could not uſe his Reaſon, and be alſo guided by the Spirit of God, at the ſame time; as if by becoming God's Interpreter, he muſt ceaſe to be a Man, and be only a Paſſive Inſtrument, if I may uſe the Term: To proceed, it is not true, that the Apoſtles never obſerved at the beginning of their Letters, that it was God who ſpake by their Mouth. For they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin their Letter, which they write to their Brethren of <hi>Antioch,</hi> by theſe words, <hi>It ſeem'd good to the Holy Ghoſt and to us;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Acts xv. 28.</note> to let them know, that what they laid upon them came from God, whoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rerpreters they only were.</p>
                     <p>The other expreſſions of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> which <hi>Spinoſa,</hi> in the ſame place, makes uſe of to ſhew, that that Apoſtle writ to gratifie his own inclination, without being encouraged thereunto by the Spirit of God; may be eaſily explained by the Principle which we have eſtabliſhed. That Man does always ſuppoſe, that Inſpiration does wholly deprive one of the uſe of his Reaſon; which is moſt falſe:<note n="(c)" place="bottom">Apoſtoli ubique ratiocinantur: it a ut non prophetare ſed diſputare videantur. <hi>Spin. ibid.</hi>
                        </note> The Apoſtles, (ſaith he) are every where upon Reaſoning, ſo that they are more like Diſputants than Prophets. But beſides, that he has formed to himſelf a falſe Idea, of the Inſpiration of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, 'tis ſufficient if we object againſt him, the example formerly given, where the Apoſtles, after they had deliberated and reaſoned
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:96711:134"/>in an Aſſembly; did nevertheleſs uſe this expreſſion, <hi>it ſeem'd to the Holy Ghoſt and to us:</hi> Which does evidently ſhew, that the Spirit of God, who had guided them in that Aſſembly, did not deprive them of the uſe of their Reaſon: There is in effect, a Subordination be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them two; the one does not deſtroy the other.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Spinoſa</hi>'s Prophets are Enthuſiaſts, who are more like Men puſh'd on by a Spirit of Fury, than by a Spirit of Prophecy. He does al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge<note n="(d)" place="bottom">Prophetiae auctoritas ratiocinari non patitur. Quiſquis enim vult ſua dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mata ratione conſirmare, eo ipſo ea arbitrali uniuſcujuſque judicio ſubmittit. <hi>Spin. ibid.</hi>
                        </note> that the quality of a Prophet does not admit of the uſe of his Reaſon; becauſe he, who confirms his Doctrines by Reaſons, does ſubmit to the judgment of others. But if one will carefully read the Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> whom he reckons amongſt the Prophets, he will own, that that Law-giver does Reaſon ſometimes: There is indeed a ſubmiſſion to the judgment of others, where there is nothing but Reaſonings. But this cannot be ſaid, when ſuch Reaſonings are guided by the Spirit of God: And this was the Caſe of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the other Prophets. <hi>Spinoſa</hi> himſelf gives an Example here; For there is none, but thinks theſe Words of <hi>Moſes,</hi> Deut. Chap. 31. v. 27. <hi>While I am yet alive with you this day, ye have been rebellious againſt the Lord; and how much more after my Death,</hi> to be very formal Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning. And indeed, the Prophets who directed their diſcourſe to Men who made uſe of their Reaſon, did not in the leaſt deſtroy their Spirit of Prophecy, when they propoſed the Will of God to thoſe Men, by way of Reaſoning.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Spinoſa</hi> (who reaſons in all this Diſcourſe upon a falſe Idea which he had of Prophecy,) does alledge,<note n="(e)" place="bottom">Verba illa Moſis moralis locutio tantùm ſunt, quâ rhetericè &amp; prout futuram populi defectionem vividiùs imaginari potuerat, praedicit. <hi>Spin. ibid.</hi>
                        </note> that that expreſſion of <hi>Moſes,</hi> was a Moral kind of ſpeaking, which he uſed as an Orator, to foretel, and repreſent to the life (ſo far as he could imagin) the future Rebellion of the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi> But what does it ſignifie, that <hi>Moſes</hi> did expreſs himſelf an Orator, or in any other manner, does that prove, that he did not truly Reaſon in that, and ſeveral other places, where he explains himſelf as other Men? It was not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that God ſhould indite all his Reaſonings and all his Exhortations. It is enough that he guided him by his Spirit, and that he prevented his falling into error. This being ſuppoſed, we will freely agree with <hi>Spinoſa,</hi> that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid many things, that were not revealed to him; and this we have proved elſewhere.</p>
                     <p>He is alſo obliged<note n="(f)" place="bottom">Nolo tamen abſolutè negare Prophetas ex revelatione argumentari potuiſſe. <hi>Ib.</hi>
                        </note> to declare, that the Prophets could Reaſon
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:96711:134"/>by Revelation; and conſequently Prophecy and Revelation are not incompatible. The Apoſtles then, could by way of reaſoning, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to the People the truths they delivered, and be at the ſame time, Inſpired with the Spirit of God. <hi>Spinoſa</hi> does nevertheleſs add, that the more that the Prophets do reaſon in form, the Knowledg that they had of things revealed, did come ſo much the more near to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Knowledge; and that that which does characterize the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Knowledg of the Prophets, is, when they pronounce Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences and Degrees without any Reaſoning. For this reaſon it is, (ſaith he) <hi>Moſes,</hi> who was the greateſt of the Prophets, made no Argument in form; that on the contrary, St. <hi>Paul</hi> does reaſon every where, and draws conſequences from the Principles which he does eſtabliſh, as appears in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans.</hi> Upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, he believed, that the Epiſtles of the Apoſtle were not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by ſupernatural Revelation.</p>
                     <p>That Man does always confound Prophecy with Enthuſiaſm. <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> who was a Law-giver, pronounced Sentences and Judgments by warrant from God; which did not hinder him from Reaſoning in ſome places: If he did not ſo, as frequently as St. <hi>Paul,</hi> the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was, he writ Hiſtories, which require no reaſoning; whereas St. <hi>Paul</hi> does write as a Doctor who inſtructs the People, and draws conſequences from Principles which he had laid down. From thence it cannot be concluded, that he followed nothing but his Reaſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that very Reaſon of his might have been ſupernaturally enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and guided by the Spirit of God. And therefore, all that <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſa</hi> does object for ſhewing, that the moſt part of that Apoſtle's Diſcourſe, does only conſiſt in Advertiſements and Moral Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, does not deſtroy the Inſpiration of the Apoſtles, in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as we have formerly ſuppoſed it with the Jeſuits of <hi>Louvain:</hi> For we made it plain, that it was not neceſſary, for that purpoſe, that God ſhould indite to St. <hi>Paul</hi> and the other Apoſtles, all their Diſcourſes of Morality. It was permitted them to make uſe of their natural Lights, and to uſe all the means with which their Reaſon could furniſh them, for perſuading the People.</p>
                     <p>After the ſame manner, all <hi>Spinoſa</hi>'s objections may be anſwered; ſeeing he does continually reaſon upon a falſe Idea, which he has formed, of the Inſpiration of the Pen-Men of the New Teſtament: We may alſo give our aſſent to a great part of what he ſays in his Objections, without giving advantage, for drawing any Concluſions againſt that Inſpiration, according to the true Explication thereof. Seeing I inſiſted long enough upon this Subject, in my two Anſwers <hi>To the Opinions of ſome Divines of</hi> Holland, it is needleſs for me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat here, what I have ſaid in thoſe two Books. The truth is, thoſe
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:96711:135"/>Divines, by oppoſing the Inſpiration of the Holy Scripture, have only given a more advantageous light to <hi>Spinoſa</hi>'s reaſons, who ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red this matter, to the falſe prejudices with which he was prepoſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. If he had read the Works of ſome Catholick Doctors who have treated judiciouſly of this Subject, he would ſoon have acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, to what little purpoſe the moſt part of his Objections ſerve, becauſe they ſtumble upon thoſe things in which we do agree with him. And therefore, we ought to be very cautious, in refuting his Opinion, that we do not conteſt with him in vain, about the things that are true, and from which he does nevertheleſs draw conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that are directly falſe or too wide; otherwiſe, we ſhall rather ſtrengthen, than deſtroy his errors.</p>

He does particularly undertake the defence of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> whom he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved to have been very converſant with the <hi>Greek</hi> Authors, and amongſt the reſt, with the Poets, whom he did imitate (as he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves) for his Expreſſion, in ſundry places.<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Haec cùm ita ſint, &amp; cùm aliundè pateat Paulum Apoſtolum Graecos ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptores evolviſſe, quî credibile ſit illum Graecae linguae non ſatis peritum fuiſſe? <hi>Henr.

                     <p>Further, it does not yet follow, but that it is demonſtrable, that the moſt part of the words that St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and the other Writers of the New Teſtament have uſed, are good <hi>Greek;</hi> only the Symetry of their Phraſes, and their modes of Speech are not always accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated to the <hi>Greek,</hi> which is not extraordinary. For every Nation has a peculiar manner of expreſſing their own thoughts; and though they deliver them in terms that are purely <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Latin,</hi> we ſoon perceive, that the Order is not altogether <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Latin.</hi> We need only for Example, look on the <hi>Greek</hi> Verſion of the Pſalms, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Ancient <hi>Latin</hi> Tranſlation, which was done out of the <hi>Greek;</hi> we ſee there ſomething that is ſingular, and not agreeable either to the <hi>Greek</hi> or the <hi>Latin Genius;</hi> when it is even ſuppoſed, that the words are pure <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin.</hi> And for this reaſon, thoſe amongſt the <hi>Greek</hi> Fathers, who had a perfect knowledge of the <hi>Greek</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, were ſometimes at a loſs, as to their comprehending the <hi>Greek</hi> of the Septuagint.</p>

                     <p>There were at that time alſo, <hi>Jews</hi> who ſpake <hi>Greek,</hi> whom they likewiſe called <hi>Greeks</hi> or <hi>Helleniſts,</hi> and the Language in which the moſt part of their Books were written, has been called in this Age, the <hi>Helleniſtick</hi> Language.

                     </p>
                     <p>The moſt able Criticks of our Age, have owned the <hi>Helleniſtick</hi> Language, to which they have had frequent recourſe for explaining many Paſſages of the New Teſtament. Yet <hi>Salmaſius,</hi> and after him <hi>Crojus,</hi> have uſed their utmoſt endeavour to cry down this new Language, which (as they imagin) was unknown to all the Ancients, and which is, as they alledge, chymerical, ſeeing it cannot be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to any of the Ancient <hi>Greek</hi> Dialects.</p>
                     <p>The former has expreſly written two Books upon this Subject, one whereof is entitled, <hi>De Helleniſticâ Commentarius,</hi> and another, <hi>Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Linguae Helleniſticae.</hi> He does really, in theſe two Works, ſhew himſelf to be a Man of great Learning: But he is ſo far from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying that Language, as he pretends, that he does confirm it in ſeveral places.</p>
                     <p>The Patrons of the <hi>Helleniſtick</hi> Language never believed, that there was a <hi>Greek</hi> Dialect of that name; and ſo, all <hi>Salmaſius</hi>'s long Diſcourſe upon the ſeveral <hi>Greek</hi> Dialects, is nothing to the purpoſe.

                     <p>In this ſenſe, there are no true <hi>Helleniſts,</hi> but thoſe who have a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Knowledge of the <hi>Greek</hi> Language: which does differ from the <hi>Helleniſtick</hi> Language, and this I would rather call the <hi>Greek</hi> of the Synagogue, becauſe it owes its Original to the Synagogues of the <hi>Jews.</hi> But thoſe who firſt call'd this Language the <hi>Helleniſtick,</hi> did it only in conformity to that place of the <hi>Acts,</hi> where the <hi>Jews</hi> are called <hi>Helleniſts,</hi> and not according to the ordinary notion of the word <hi>Helleniſt. Salmaſius</hi> does grant, that there are many <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braiſms</hi> in the Verſion of the Septuagint, and in the Writings of the Apoſtles. He only denies, that we ought, upon that account, to call that the <hi>Helleniſtick</hi> Language, in which thoſe Books were written: Otherwiſe, (ſaith he) we ought to give the ſame name to the Ancient Latin Verſion of the Bible, becauſe there is alſo a great many <hi>Hebraiſms</hi> in that Verſion: But it was neceſſary that it ſhould have been written in <hi>Greek,</hi> before it could be called an <hi>Helleniſtick</hi> Verſion. We do not call the Language of the Septuagint, and of the New Teſtament <hi>Helleniſtick,</hi> merely becauſe it contains many <hi>Hebraiſms,</hi> but becauſe it is <hi>Greek</hi> mixed with <hi>Hebraiſms.</hi>

Now <hi>Salmaſius</hi> does, in his two Books, ſuppoſe certain Principles which manifeſtly eſtabliſh the Language which ſome Criticks, in this laſt Age, have called the <hi>Helleniſtick.</hi> He aſſures us, for example, that the Seventy Interpreters, who underſtood the <hi>Greek</hi> very well,<note n="(c)" place="bottom">Niſi verbum verbo in pluribus reddere curaſſent, longè, ut ita dicam, Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catiorem &amp; omnibus Hebraiſmis totidemque barbariſmis repurgatam potuiſſent edere tranſlationem.

According to this ſuppoſition, the <hi>Greek</hi> of the Septuagint is not pure, but <hi>Greek</hi> mixed with <hi>Hebraiſms;</hi> and they have likewiſe given new ſignifications to <hi>Greek</hi> words, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to expreſs the ſenſe of the Original.

                        </note> that it is more clear than the day; that that <hi>Greek</hi> Language that belonged to no Nation, and that had no mark, to characteriſe or diſtinguiſh it from other Dialects, is not a true Dialect.</p>
                     <p>But that was not the thing he was to prove, becauſe we are of the ſame Opinion with him, that that which ſome able Criticks have called the <hi>Helleniſtick</hi> Language is none of the <hi>Greek</hi> Dialects. They only think, that that Language is not pure <hi>Greek,</hi> by reaſon of the <hi>Hebraiſms</hi> with which it abounds.

All the Queſtion then is to know, if the Verſion of the Septuagint, and the Books of the Old Teſtament be written in this manner: Since he himſelf does grant this, it may be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from hence, that thoſe Writers have no particular and proper Language. It is not to be look'd for in any Dialect of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> nor in any Nation in particular, but in the Synagogues of the <hi>Jews-Greeks</hi> or <hi>Helleniſts.</hi> As, if at this day, I would know, what is the Language of the Bibles Printed in <hi>Spaniſh</hi> at <hi>Ferrara,</hi> and at <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> I would not look for a particular Nation that ſpeaks that Language, but would conſult the uſage of their Synagogues. The Apoſtles who frequented the Synagogues of the <hi>Jews-Helleniſts,</hi> and who read with them, the <hi>Greek</hi> Verſion of the Septuagint, borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the expreſſions thereof; beſides, being <hi>Jews</hi> by Birth, and the <hi>Chaldee</hi> being their Mother Tongue, it was very hard for them not to mix ſome <hi>Hebraiſms</hi> and <hi>Chaldaiſms</hi> with the <hi>Greek</hi> in which they writ.</p>

                     <p>But whence was it (it may be ſaid) that thoſe <hi>Jews-Helleniſts,</hi> whoſe Vulgar Language was the <hi>Greek,</hi> ſpake that <hi>Greek</hi> of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue, that is to ſay, a <hi>Greek</hi> mixed with <hi>Hebraiſms</hi> and <hi>Chalda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſms;</hi> ſeeing the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Chaldee</hi> was not then in uſe amongſt them? <hi>Philon</hi> for Example, who was one of thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> that were called <hi>Helleniſts,</hi> ſpake <hi>Greek</hi> very well.

                     <p>To this it may be anſwered, that the <hi>Greek Helleniſts</hi> did continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally read the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Bible in their Synagogues, as well as the other <hi>Jews,</hi> who called themſelves purely <hi>Hebrews:</hi> Although thoſe <hi>Helle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi> writ ſome particular Works in pure <hi>Greek,</hi> which had nothing of the <hi>Greek</hi> of the Synagogue, it was not the ſame thing as their <hi>Greek</hi> Verſions of the Bible, and ſome other of their Books. Seeing in theſe Works, they confined themſelves to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text, they expreſſed the form of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Phraſe. This may be juſtified by the <hi>Arabick, Perſian, Spaniſh,</hi> and the Vulgar <hi>Greek</hi> Verſions of the Bible, which were made by the <hi>Jews.</hi> There are pure <hi>Hebraiſms</hi> owned to be in all theſe, although the Authors thereof were <hi>Jews,</hi> who ſpake thoſe Languages: Which could proceed from nothing elſe but their ſcrupulous adhering in their Tranſlations, to the Words of the Original <hi>Hebrew.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is true, that the moſt part of thoſe who defend the <hi>Helleniſtick</hi> Language, believe, that the <hi>Jews-Helleniſts</hi> did read no other Bible

I ſhall ſpeak of theſe two Books, and ſome other the like, in the third Part of this Critical Hiſtory. I ſhall only confine my ſelf here to <hi>Salmaſius</hi> his Reaſons, by which he pretends to ſhew, that all that is ſaid of the <hi>Helleniſtick</hi> Language is without a Foundation.</p>
                     <p>This Learned Critick does abſolutely deny that the Seventy Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters were <hi>Helleniſts,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Salm. in Epiſt. dedic.

                        <pb n="104" facs="tcp:96711:145"/>In <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> they did read the Bible in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and not in <hi>Greek.</hi> If they joyned to it any Gloſs, it was written in the Language of the <hi>Jews</hi> of that Place, that is to ſay in the <hi>Chaldee.</hi> The ſame thing (ſaith <hi>Salmaſius</hi>) may be alledged as to the Apoſtles, who for the moſt part were <hi>Jews</hi> Originally, and who lived in <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi> even after the death of Jeſus Chriſt. How then is it poſſible that they could be <hi>Greeks</hi> or <hi>Helleniſts?</hi> There was only St. <hi>Paul</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, who (being of <hi>Tarſus</hi> in <hi>Cilicia,</hi> where they ſpake the <hi>Greek</hi> Language) could aſſume the quality of a <hi>Jew-Helleniſt.</hi> But having been bred at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where he Studied under the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Rabbin <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> he denominates himſelf a mere <hi>Hebrew, Hebraeus ex Hebraeis.</hi> Indeed, ſince he was of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be reckoned in the number of the <hi>Jews-Helleniſts,</hi> who did read the Bible in <hi>Greek</hi> in their Synagogues.</p>
                     <p>It is eaſie to ſolve all theſe difficulties with the leaſt trouble ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable. It may be obſerved, that although the Appellation of <hi>Jews-Helleniſts,</hi> was given to thoſe who were ſcattered out of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daea,</hi> into thoſe ſeveral Countries where they ſpake the <hi>Greek</hi> Language, this does not hinder, but that there may be found true <hi>Helleniſts</hi> even in the Land of <hi>Judah:</hi> for every <hi>Jew</hi> who writ in that <hi>Greek,</hi> which we have formerly called the <hi>Greek</hi> of the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, may be called a <hi>Helleniſt,</hi> by reaſon of the Language he uſed in writing his Works. Upon this ground, when it ſhall be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that the Authors of the ancient <hi>Greek</hi> Verſion, which is aſcribed to the Seventy Interpreters, were of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> they are truly <hi>Helleniſts,</hi> becauſe they Compoſed their Verſion in a <hi>Greek,</hi> that is full of <hi>Hebraiſms</hi> and of <hi>Chaldaiſms.</hi> The Apoſtles who were of <hi>Galilee,</hi> and conſequently natural born <hi>Jews,</hi> are alſo in this Senſe <hi>Jews-Helleniſts,</hi> if they be conſidered as the Authors of ſuch Books as they writ in the <hi>Greek</hi> of the Synagogue.

Yet he ought to be reckoned among the <hi>Helleniſts,</hi> if we conſider his Works, which are written in a <hi>Greek</hi> Stile full of <hi>Hebraiſms,</hi> in which, by common ſuffrage, the <hi>Helleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick</hi> Language does conſiſt.</p>

                        <hi>Salmaſius</hi> does object againſt this, that the modes of Speech in a Language do change according to the Times, whilſt the name of the Language does not change. If ſo, it cannot be ſaid, that an <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> or <hi>Syriack</hi> Phraſe,<note place="margin">Salm. de Lang. Hellen. <hi>p. 131.</hi>
                        </note> which is delivered in pure <hi>Greek</hi> terms, can conſtitute a particular Language or Dialect of a Nation. It does only give a new Character of the Language. The Stile of the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:96711:145"/>Poets, for example, is very remote from the ordinary <hi>Greek.</hi> Yet none ever affirmed that that was a particular Language. So it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaid that the <hi>Helleniſtick</hi> Language, does make a particular Dialect common to a whole Nation, as if it were a Language ſpoken by the Community. They were content to confine it to their Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, and the Works of thoſe who writ in the Language of the Synagogue. Let it be only called, if one pleaſe, a new Character in the <hi>Greek</hi> Language. But this is nothing to the Queſtion, ſeeing we Diſpute not of the Word, but of the Thing. <hi>Salmaſius</hi> does grant, that the <hi>Greek</hi> Verſion of the Septuagint, and of the Books of the New Teſtament are written in <hi>Greek,</hi> full of <hi>Hebraiſms:</hi> we require no more for the Confirmation of the <hi>Helleniſtick</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.</p>
                     <p>It is poſſible that the <hi>Helleniſticaries</hi> abuſe the Word Language. But it is ſufficient that they do explain what they underſtand by this Word, and that they own, that they did not intend thereby the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Language of a Nation. For it is certain, that the <hi>Jews, Greeks,</hi> or <hi>Helleniſts,</hi> did every one ſpeak the <hi>Greek</hi> Language of the places where they were. St. <hi>Paul,</hi> for example, ſpake the <hi>Greek</hi> which was in his time uſed at <hi>Tarſus. Philon</hi> ſpake the <hi>Greek</hi> of thoſe of <hi>Alexandria:</hi> and ſeeing he had Studied that Language with great Application, he writ in a Stile that was exceedingly poliſhed. Nevertheleſs all the <hi>Jews,</hi> who were <hi>Greeks</hi> or <hi>Helleniſts,</hi> did not write in the Language which is here called the <hi>Helleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick,</hi> becauſe it was Conſecrated chiefly to the uſe of the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, and was framed according to the Language of the Holy Writings. The <hi>Jews</hi> who were purely <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and who writ in <hi>Greek,</hi> were more <hi>Helleniſticaries,</hi> than the <hi>Jews-Helleniſts</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, becauſe their Stile did more abound with <hi>Hebraiſms,</hi> and <hi>Chaldaiſms,</hi> than that of the <hi>Helleniſts,</hi> who had the <hi>Greek</hi> for their Vulgar Language.</p>
                     <p>And though we ſhould ſuppoſe with <hi>Salmaſius,</hi> that the moſt part of the Diſciples of Jeſus Chriſt, being <hi>Galileans,</hi> and of the Dregs of the People, ſpake no other Language but the <hi>Syriack,</hi> it could not from thence be proved, that the Books of the Old Teſtament that are in <hi>Greek,</hi> are not written in the <hi>Helleniſtick</hi> Language. All that can be proved from that ſuppoſition is, that the Apoſtles did then compoſe their Works in their Mother Tongue, which was the <hi>Syriack,</hi> and that they were afterwards Tranſlated into <hi>Greek</hi> by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters, who accompanied them in their Travels, and who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the <hi>Greek</hi> Language. This is truly the Opinion of that Critick, who believed that the moſt part of the Apoſtles were but very ſlow in learning the <hi>Greek,</hi> at that time when they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:96711:146"/>to Preach the Goſpel to the <hi>Gentiles.</hi>

All that can be concluded from his Suppoſition is, that the Books which were written by the Diſciples of Jeſus Chriſt, who were <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lileans,</hi> were not compoſed by <hi>Jews-Helleniſts,</hi> but by mere <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,</hi> in the Language of their Country, which was the <hi>Chaldaick</hi> Language.</p>
                     <p>He cannot conclude from thence, that the <hi>Greek</hi> of the Books which we have at this day, is not a <hi>Greek</hi> of the Synagogues.

                        <hi>Salmaſius</hi> does further aſſure us, againſt the Opinion of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Eccleſiaſtical Writers,<note n="(d)" place="bottom">Graecè neſciſſe Apoſtolos vel uno vincitur argumento, quod ex Septuaginta In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretum Verſione teſtimonia non citarint, ſed ex Hebraico textu. <hi>Salm. de Hellen. pag. 255.</hi>
                        </note> that amongſt all the Apoſtles, it was only St. <hi>Paul</hi> who underſtood the <hi>Greek.</hi> Which he proves by their citing the Old Teſtament according to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text, and not according to the <hi>Greek</hi> of the Septuagint. But we have already ſhewn the contrary: and although St. <hi>Jerom</hi> is ſomtimes of that Opinion, he frequently takes the oppoſite ſide upon very good Reaſons. The Reaſon, (<hi>Salmaſius</hi> adds) why the Paſſages of the Old Teſtament, which are cited in the New, do not agree with the <hi>Greek</hi> of the Septuagint, is becauſe the Evangeliſts and the Apoſtles took them from the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and the Interpreters, Tranſlating them into <hi>Greek,</hi> do not always agree with the Septuagint. But if it were ſo, thoſe Tranſlators would at leaſt have expreſſed the <hi>Hebrew</hi> by other <hi>Greek</hi> Words, and would have been conformable to that <hi>Hebrew:</hi> which yet is not true, for they agree more often with the Septuagint, than with the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text. This difference, as it has been elſewhere obſerved, proceeds from this, that the Apoſtles according to the uſage of their time, did not trouble themſelves in their citations to relate the expreſs Words of Scripture, becauſe they adhered chiefly to the Senſe.</p>
                     <p>But was it neceſſary (<hi>Salmaſius</hi> continues) that St. <hi>Peter,</hi> who was an Apoſtle of the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſhould underſtand the <hi>Greek</hi> Language, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Jews</hi> of that time underſtood the <hi>Syriack</hi> and the <hi>Hebrew?</hi> It is not true that all the <hi>Jews</hi> of that time underſtood the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and the <hi>Syriack.</hi> For in all the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, only thoſe of <hi>Paleſtine</hi> knew the <hi>Syriack</hi> or the <hi>Chaldee,</hi> and yet thoſe of that Country who were above the Common Rank, did likewiſe underſtand the <hi>Greek</hi> Language. As for the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> there were only a very few Learned Men amongſt them who underſtood it; whereas the <hi>Greek</hi> Language was ſpread through a conſiderable part of the Empire, and the <hi>Jews</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> where St. <hi>Peter</hi> was, accompanied with St. <hi>Mark,</hi> ſpake <hi>Greek</hi> more than any other Language. To that which is objected, that St. <hi>Mark,</hi> according to the teſtimony of all Antiquity, was St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Interpreter; I anſwer, that it cannot be proved from thence that S. <hi>Peter</hi> was altogether ignorant of the <hi>Greek</hi> Language, ſeeing all thoſe
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:96711:147"/>ancient Doctors of the Church, who make St. <hi>Mark</hi> to be St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Interpreter, do not deny but that this Holy Apoſtle underſtood the <hi>Greek.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> had likewiſe <hi>Titus</hi> for his Interpreter; and yet <hi>Salma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> thinks that that Apoſtle knew the <hi>Greek</hi> better than the <hi>Hebrew.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We will freely grant to this Critick, that St. <hi>John,</hi> who was a <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilean,</hi> had a more exact knowledge of the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> or rather of the <hi>Chaldaick</hi> Language, than of the <hi>Greek.</hi> But it cannot be from thence inferred with him, that that Apoſtle did Write his Goſpel in the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew,</hi> rather than in the <hi>Greek.</hi> For having eſtabliſhed his abode in the places where the <hi>Greek</hi> was ſpoken, he inſtructed the ſeveral People whoſe Apoſtle he was, in the Language which they ſpake. And ſeeing his Goſpel is only a Collection of his Sermons, he writ it in the ſame Language.

It is much more probable that the Apoſtles, who were <hi>Galileans,</hi> are the Authors thereof.

                     <p>As for St. <hi>Paul</hi> and St. <hi>Luke,</hi> who underſtood the <hi>Greek</hi> Language, <hi>Salmaſius</hi> does alſo acknowledge that their Writings are full of <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daiſms:</hi> and the Reaſon that he brings, is,<note n="(g)" place="bottom">Quod de Paulo &amp; Lucâ licet aſſerere, qui utriuſque linguae periti, in eam quâ ſcripſerunt ex alterâ phraſes &amp; genera lequendi transfuderunt. <hi>Salm. ibid.</hi>

In what manner ſoever it happened, he cannot deny but that the Language of the Synagogue does appear in the Works of St. <hi>Paul</hi> and of St. Luke, as well as in the Writings of the other Apoſtles. He only thinks that St. <hi>Paul</hi> and St. <hi>Luke</hi> let <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braiſms</hi> drop more ſeldom than the Interpreters, who (as he believes) Tranſlated the Books of the other Apoſtles out of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and the <hi>Chaldee,</hi> into the <hi>Greek.</hi> Yet <hi>Vorſtius,</hi> as I have already obſerved, has marked more <hi>Hebraiſms</hi> in St. <hi>Luke,</hi> than in the other Writers of the New Teſtament. And therefore it is better to attribute them to the Apoſtles themſelves, if St. <hi>Matthew</hi> be excepted, than to their Fellow Helpers or Interpreters.</p>
                     <p>For what remains we agree with <hi>Salmaſius,</hi> or rather with the <hi>Greek</hi> Fathers, whom he follows in this matter, that the Apoſtles being rude and deſtitute of Literature, writ their Books in a very mean Stile, and in a Language that was uſed by the Dregs of the People. Which in ſome manner renders their Diſcourſe more intelligible, becauſe that Language does commonly contain nothing that is Figurative as to what concerns the Expreſſions. We ſhall obſerve nevertheleſs, that altho the Apoſtles do ordinarily make uſe of Words that are mean and received amongſt the People, and conſequently eaſie to be underſtood, they have a certain form of Phraſe, and certain Expreſſions which were proper to thoſe of their Nation; which appear ſometimes obſcure to us, becauſe we know not the uſage of that time. Altho their Stile is oftentimes ſimple and very plain, if we look only to the Grammatical Senſe, it is hard enough to be underſtood, when we intend to reach the true Senſe of their Thoughts. The <hi>Jews</hi> had then ways of Expreſſing themſelves, very different from thoſe that are in uſe amongſt us: And in this, the obſcurity of the Books of the N. Teſtament doth chiefly conſiſt.</p>
                     <p>They who Tranſlate thoſe Books into another Language, ought eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to take care to keep as cloſe as poſſible to the Words of the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal. For when they endeavour to render the bare Senſe, without adhering to the Words, they run a riſque of deceiving themſelves, and making their Author ſpeak thoſe things which he never thought of. <hi>Beza</hi> and <hi>Caſtalio</hi> had great Diſputes about this. The former alledged, that in Tranſlating the New Teſtament ſeveral <hi>Hebraiſms</hi> ought to be retained, becauſe it is impoſſible to render them exactly in another

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:96711:148"/>Teſtament, adding to, and taking away from it, according as they judged it convenient. Indeed, if it be remembred what was briefly ſaid of it, upon the occaſion of the laſt Chapter of S. <hi>Mark,</hi> and of the Hiſtory of the adulterous Woman, Chap. 8. of S. <hi>John,</hi> we ſhall find evident proofs there of this obſervation of <hi>Origen:</hi> which would further appear, if we had ſeveral Copies of that time, which we might compare with thoſe that remain, whereas we have very few that are above a thouſand years continuance; and which, as we ſhall ſhew in the next Chapter, do very much differ from thoſe others we have at this day. They have likewiſe all thoſe Errors that we have obſerved.</p>
                     <p>That Father does add, in the ſame place, that he had in ſome ſort remedied the diverſity of the <hi>Greek</hi> Copies of the Septuagint Verſion, which he had reviſed and corrected according to the ordinary Rules of Criticiſm. He likewiſe declares in what manner he had gone through that great Work, that had all the ſucceſs that he could hope for. But he did not the like as to the Books of the New Teſtament, unleſs it be that he carefully ſearched for the moſt correct Copies, and made many Critical Reflections on ſundry places, according as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions did preſent themſelves for that purpoſe. Neither do we find that the Eccleſiaſtical Writers, who lived after <hi>Origen,</hi> made a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of two ſorts of Editions of the New Teſtament, as they have of two Editions of the Verſion of the Septuagint. They made a difference betwixt that which was called <gap reason="foreign">

They conſidered this latter as the true Edition of the Septuagint, altho it was as yet very imperfect, and the moſt part of the Oriental Churches made uſe of it for correcting their Copies.</p>
                     <p>Yet for all this, <hi>Origen</hi> as well as ſeveral other Criticks did correct ſome <hi>Greek</hi> Copies of the New Teſtament, and S. <hi>Jerom</hi> does ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times cite them. But it does not appear that his Critical Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were in the place of a Law, as to thoſe Books, as they were as to an ancient <hi>Greek</hi> Verſion of the Old Teſtament. If it had been ſo, we ſhould have had a Maſſore of the <hi>Greek</hi> Text of the Writings of the Evangeliſts and the Apoſtles, in the ſame manner as the <hi>Jews</hi> had of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text of the Bible. We ſhould not find ſo many different Readings as there are at this day. For every one would have exactly followed <hi>Origen</hi>'s Copy, as the <hi>Jews</hi> followed the Copy that was corrected by their Doctors, whom they commonly called Maſſorets. And from hence it is that we find not at this day any ancient <hi>Hebrew</hi> Copies of the Scripture amongſt them. For they reformed them all by the Maſſore: and ſeeing they hold it for infallible, they wholly
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:96711:149"/>neglected their ancient Books. They are ſo much perſuaded, that the Books of the Law which they now read, are perfectly conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Original of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that they do keep in their Synagogues any old Roll or Volume. The <hi>Jews</hi> of the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Synagogue of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> have at leaſt fifty Rolls of their <hi>Sepher tora,</hi> or <hi>Book of the Law,</hi> which, for the moſt part, are very well written, but they are all new. If any ask for ancient ones, they take no notice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are prepoſſeſſed with a Belief, that there can be no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt the ancient and the modern.</p>
                     <p>It is not ſo amongſt the Chriſtians who have had no Maſſorets, whom they altogether follow in copying their <hi>Greek</hi> Copies of the New Teſtament. And therefore we ought not to be ſurpriſed, to find therein a much greater number of various Renditions than in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Copies of the <hi>Jews.</hi> I dare alſo be bold to ſay, that this manifold variety ought to gain a greater authority to them, than if there had been no ſuch difference. For it is impoſſible, that a Book which has paſſed through ſo many hands ſhould always continue the ſame, unleſs they have corrected it, and afterwards follow exactly that Correction, as it happened to the <hi>Jews,</hi> in reſpect of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text of the Old Teſtament. It is the advantage of a Book, that there have been ſeveral different Copies thereof, to the end that a better Judgment may be given of the true Rendition. And upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, the Books of the New Teſtament are to be preferred to the moſt part of the others, becauſe the Chriſtian Religion having ſpread into ſo many different Countries, every Nation has Copies and Verſions thereof.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are the different Copies by which we are to be guided at this day, becauſe we have not now the firſt Original. We ſhall with all poſſible exactneſs examine the <hi>Greek</hi> Manuſcript Copies, and alſo the moſt ancient Verſions which have been taken from the <hi>Greek.</hi> We are not to depend upon one <hi>Greek</hi> Edition more than upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if it be not founded on better Manuſcripts. We ſhall prefer the Editions which, together with the Text, do contain divers Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of ſundry Copies. It is a rare thing to find <hi>Greek</hi> Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts where ſuch variations are noted in the Margin; for ſeeing thoſe Books are read in the Churches, they obſerve commonly no other Reading than what is authoriſed by cuſtom. They did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themſelves to mark them in diſtinct Works, eſpecially in the Notes which they joyned to the <hi>Greek</hi> Text of the New Teſtament. And therefore beſides the various Manuſcript Copies, we ought to conſult the Notes which it is eaſie enough to find in good Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braries.</p>

                     <p>Many Learned Criticks of the latter Days, when the Study of the <hi>Greek</hi> Language was re-eſtabliſhed, applied themſelves carefully to this Labor. <hi>Valla</hi> was the firſt who made ſearch for the <hi>Greek</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of the New Teſtament, and alſo for the <hi>Latin.</hi>

For he has placed the various Readings of ſix Manuſcript Copies, in the Margin of his Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and thus, though he commonly follows the Edition of <hi>Ximenes</hi> in his Text, he is not obliged to adhere to it, unleſs he were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, that the renditions of the Cardinal's Copy are the beſt in thoſe places. It is no great matter for a Reading to be inſerted in the Body of a Book, or to be placed in the Margin, provided that it be known that thoſe which are in the Margin are taken from good Manuſcript Copies, as well as thoſe which are in the Text. It were alſo much to be deſired, for obſerving a greater uniformity, that thoſe who have publiſhed new Editions of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in <hi>Greek,</hi> had all of them exactly followed the <hi>Alcala,</hi> or the <hi>Complutum</hi> Edition, which is the firſt, and that they had contented themſelves to refer to the Margin the various Readings of their Manuſcripts.</p>

I have had more than twenty of that ſort from</hi> France; <hi>all thoſe of the</hi> Vatican, <hi>and the famous</hi> Italian <hi>Libraries; ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen from</hi> Spain, <hi>not to reckon others, with which Cardinal</hi> Ximenes <hi>uſed to perfect his Bible of</hi> Alcala; <hi>thoſe of</hi> England <hi>and the Northern Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and many from the innermoſt Parts of</hi> Greece, <hi>with thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the ſeveral Fathers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is none who reads thoſe Words but would believe, that that Father had in his hands all thoſe Copies whereof he makes mention, at leaſt the Extracts of the Manuſcripts. But all that long Diſcourſe is only a Rhetorical flouriſh which he uſes, that the Subject of which he treats of may be embelliſhed with a noble ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, according to the lofty Idea which he had of it. And this he avowed to one of his Fraternity, to whom he ſhewed his Preface in Writing, and who adviſed him to amend it, eſpecially in that place where he makes mention of his Manuſcripts. He made no other Anſwer about it, to his Brother, who at the ſame time ſhew'd him thoſe various Readings in Print, but, that the ſubject matter requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that he ſhould expreſs himſelf in a noble manner, to make the greater impreſſion in the minds of thoſe who read his Works. So that all thoſe Venerable and Auguſt Manuſcripts, which <hi>F. Amelote</hi> conſulted are nothing elſe but a Figure of Rhetorick.</p>
                     <p>Indeed, if he had made ſuch an exact ſcrutiny into thoſe Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts, he ought to have told us another ſtory than what is found in the Catalogues, that have been Printed of them. It is true, that he writ into <hi>Spain,</hi> to know what had become of thoſe that belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Marqueſs of <hi>Veles.</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">Mr. d' Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſſeau.</note> The Archbiſhop of <hi>Ambrun,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador, then at that Court, who was one of his Friends, made him Anſwer, that he had no account at <hi>Madrid,</hi> of the Manuſcripts of that Marqueſs. He continued the ſame Rhetorical Figure, when he would perſuade us, that he obtained Copies of many various read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings by the means of his Friends; For he ſhew'd nothing of that nature, but what was contained in the Sixth Volume of the Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glott of <hi>England,</hi> or in <hi>Lacerda</hi> the Jeſuit, or in F. <hi>Morin.</hi> It was by the aſſiſtance of the latter, that he framed a deſign of collecting the various Readings that eſtabliſh the ancient Latin Edition: It were eaſie to let him ſee, by his own words, that he did not very well underſtand that ſort of Criticiſm. He was ſo far from having all the Extracts of the Manuſcript mentioned by him, that it ſeems, that he had not the skill to read the Catalogues of thoſe Manuſcripts perfectly. For I would fain know, what he meant by the two Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcripts of <hi>Magdebourg</hi> College in <hi>Oxford,</hi> which he mentions in the two Prefaces to his <hi>French</hi> New Teſtament. He had read in the

You may ſee in what manner he marks them in his Latin Preface <hi>Magd.</hi> 1. <hi>Magdeburgenſis Collegii apud Oxonium Novum Teſtamentum integrum, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptâ Apocalypſi.

                     <p>It was eaſie for Mr. <hi>Arnauld</hi> to refute him upon this Subject, in his <hi>New defence of the Tranſlation of the New Teſtament, Printed at Mons.</hi> I could only have wiſhed that he had not reckon'd as Chimerical, that which F. <hi>Amelote,</hi> and after him Mr. <hi>Mallet,</hi> call the Vulgar <hi>Greek,</hi> that is to ſay, for the explaining of the Vulgar Edition of the <hi>Greek</hi> Text of the New Teſtament. It is true, that theſe two Authors had a falſe notion of this Vulgar <hi>Greek;</hi> but that does not hinder, but that they might very well have uſed that expreſſion, when they compared the ordinary Editions of the <hi>Greek</hi> New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with the various Readings of many. Ancient Manuſcripts. And in this ſenſe, they gave the appellation of <gap reason="foreign">

It may be alſo ſaid upon good grounds, that this Vulgar <hi>Greek</hi> was altered in ſundry places, and that therefore it is not juſtifiable, that we ſhould forſake the Vulgar, whenever it does not agree with the Vulgar <hi>Greek.</hi> Upon this ground <hi>Mariana</hi> the Jeſuit obſerved, that it is not likely, that the Ancient Latin Interpreter is the Author of all the various Readings, that make ſo great a difference betwixt the <hi>Greek</hi> and the <hi>Latin.

                     <p>According to this Obſervation, the <hi>Greek</hi> of the New Teſtament may be called, as it was Printed, a Vulgar <hi>Greek,</hi> if it be compared with the Ancient Manuſcripts, which the Latin Interpreter made uſe of, and yet for all that, thoſe Manuſcripts ought not to have the denomination of the Apoſtolical <hi>Greek,</hi> and of the firſt Original. F. <hi>Morin</hi> has alſo given it the name of the Vulgar <hi>Greek,</hi> or that which has been publiſhed in our time. <hi>Cogitent ergo</hi> (ſaith he to the Proteſtants, who are very apt to leave the Ancient Latin Edition) <hi>quoties Vulgatam à Graeco Vulgato diſſentientem deprehendunt, ſed cum vetuſtiſſimis codicibus eſſe conſenſum, à quibus degeneres ſunt neoterici Graeci.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is moreover a long time, ſince this difference has been obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the <hi>Greek</hi> Copies of the New Teſtament, which is founded upon the Rules of Criticiſm. The appellation of Vulgar has been always given to the common Copies of the Bible, to diſtinguiſh them from thoſe that were corrected by Criticks, and are therefore believed to be more exact. The <hi>Jews</hi> for example, reform their common and ordinary Copies by thoſe of the <hi>Maſſoret. Hilarius</hi> Deacon of <hi>Rome</hi> puts a great value on this Rule, in his Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry upon the fifth Chapter of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> v. 14. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects the Vulgar Reading of the <hi>Greek</hi> Copies, aſſuring us, that they can never be uſed ſo as to prevail againſt the Latin Edition, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they vary. <hi>Sic praeſcribitur nobis,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>de Graecis codicibus qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſi non ipſi ab invicem diſcrepent.</hi> He has recourſe to the moſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Greek</hi> Copies, from which the Latin Verſion was taken.

                        </note> he is perſwaded that the Latin Copies were not corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he believes, that the <hi>Greek</hi> from which they were taken is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and true.</p>
                     <p>F. <hi>Amelote,</hi> might according to this ſenſe, have diſtinguiſhed the <hi>Greek</hi> at this day, from the ancient and true <hi>Greek,</hi> and have called the former the Vulgar <hi>Greek.</hi> But it does not follow from thence, that that Ancient <hi>Greek</hi> is free from all faults, and that it muſt be always preferred to the <hi>Greek</hi> which is called New. For this latter <hi>Greek</hi> is no otherwiſe New, but in reſpect of its being publiſhed in theſe latter times. And it may happen, that this New <hi>Greek</hi> may be found agreeable to the moſt Ancient Authors, and that it is conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:96711:154"/>very ancient. And therefore <hi>Hilarius</hi> the Deacon gives us three Qualities, the conſideration of which ought to induce us to prefer one Copy to another. <hi>Hoc verum arbitror,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>quando &amp; Ratio &amp; Hiſtoria &amp; Authoritas obſervatur:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ambroſ. ibid.</note> He grounds the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which he believes to be the beſt in that place, upon the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> of <hi>Victorin,</hi> and St. <hi>Cyprian.</hi> Whence he does con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the Vulgar <hi>Greek</hi> of his time was not to be followed, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there were more ancient and more true Copies, in which the Reading was otherwiſe. I do not inquire, if that Deacon was ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifiable in the matter of which he treated: I content my ſelf with propoſing the Rule that he gives us, by which we may diſtinguiſh the Copies that are called Vulgar or Common, from others that are more Ancient and more Correct.</p>
                     <p>This being once ſuppoſed, we ſhall avoid many unprofitable Queſtions, which Mr. <hi>Arnauld</hi> does ſeriouſly handle, upon the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of the Vulgar <hi>Greek,</hi> which he alledges to be extant in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion only, and which (ſaith he) we ought firſt to make, before we ſpeak of it. This Learned Man does afterwards endeavour to prove, that that name is neither to be given to <hi>Robert Stephen</hi>'s Edition, nor to that of the Cardinal <hi>Ximenes,</hi> nor to any other, becauſe, (as he thinks) it is Chimerical, and of F. <hi>Amelote</hi>'s invention, <hi>who fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to himſelf a certain Vulgar</hi> Greek, <hi>the moſt erroneous that could be imagined, in oppoſition to the Vulgar, that the faults of the one might ballance the perfections of the other.</hi> I am apt to believe, that that Father does entertain falſe Idea's of that which is called the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar <hi>Greek?</hi> But if he be underſtood in the manner we have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſhewn, it is no <hi>Chimera</hi> nor fancy. If the Authors of the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation of the New Teſtament, Printed at <hi>Mons,</hi> have ſometimes followed the Vulgar <hi>Greek</hi> in their Verſion, without making men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any other <hi>Greek,</hi> they are in that to be blamed: For it cannot be abſolutely affirmed, that the <hi>Greek</hi> is read in ſome places, otherwiſe than the Latin, when there are <hi>Greek</hi> Copies where the Reading is the ſame with the Latin: Neither muſt we always prefer the <hi>Greek</hi> Copies that agree with the Latin E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, to the Common and Ordinary. We are to judge of thoſe Readings according to the Rules of Criticiſm, and examin with the Deacon <hi>Hilary;</hi> which of thoſe Copies are Founded on Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, on Hiſtory, and on Authority. The <hi>Greek</hi> wherein theſe things do meet, ſhall be the moſt ancient and the moſt correct, whether it be found in the Old Manuſcripts, or in the Printed Books.</p>
                     <p>There is then nothing more falſe, than the Idea that School Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, and ſome Canoniſts have formed, of the <hi>Greek</hi> Copies of the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:96711:154"/>New Teſtament. For under the pretence of defending the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Ancient Latin Edition, they alledge, that when there is any difference betwixt the <hi>Greek</hi> Copies at this day and the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin, we ought always to prefer the Latin to the Greek; becauſe the <hi>Greeks</hi> (ſay they) being Schiſmaticks have corrupted their Books, whereas the Truth has remained in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; there is nothing more unjuſt than this thought; For it is eaſie to go back to the time before the Schiſm, and to ſhew that the <hi>Origen</hi>'s, the <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi>'s, and ſeveral other Fathers of that Church had the Reading in their Copies, in the ſame manner as theſe have it, whom at this day we call Schiſmaticks.</p>
                     <p>This moſt unjuſt accuſation is nevertheleſs very Ancient: So ſoon as ever there is a difference perceived in Copies, if this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference do favour the Opinions of ſome Party, they will be ſure to accuſe that Party of corrupting the Sacred Writings, although that difference does for the moſt part come from the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribers. <hi>Hilary</hi> the Deacon has made a general Rule, in that place formerly mentioned: He aſſures us,<note n="(m)" place="bottom">Quod fecit ſtudium contentionis. Quia enim propriâ quis auctoritate uti non poteſt ad victoriam, verba legis adulterat, ut ſenſum ſuum quaſi verba legis aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerat, ut non ratio, ſed auctoritas praeſcribere videatur. <hi>Ambroſ. ibid.</hi>
                        </note> that the Spirit of diſpute, that is betwixt different Parties is the cauſe of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Renditions. Every one (ſaith he) ſeeing he cannot on ſuch occaſions, juſtifie himſelf by his own Authority, does corrupt the Words of the Law, that he may make his own Opinions paſs for the Words of the Law.</p>
                     <p>Although that has happened ſometimes, eſpecially to thoſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Hereticks of whom we ſpake in the beginning of this Work, I am perſwaded, that they have frequently attributed to different Parties, ſuch various Renditions in the Copies of the New Teſtament, as had no other cauſe Originally, but what thoſe have which are found in all other Books. How many Divines are there, for example, who believe at this day, that they have taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from the Ancient <hi>Greek</hi> Copies, the Teſtimony of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt; of which mention is made in the firſt Epiſtle of St. <hi>John,</hi> Chap. 5. v. 7. to favour the <hi>Arian</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie. Others, on the contrary do alledge, that it was the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> who added theſe Words expreſly to the <hi>Greek</hi> Text, to ſhew, the Unity of the Perſons of the Trinity is not an Unity of Eſſence, but of Conſent. <hi>Grotius</hi> is of this latter Opinion:
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:96711:155"/>He thinks<note n="(n)" place="bottom">Neque verò Arianis ablatas eſſe voces quaſdam, ſed potiùs additas, unde colligerent <hi>Patrem &amp; Filium &amp; Spiritum Sanctum</hi> non eſſe unum niſi conſenſu, quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modo <hi>ſpiritus, aqua &amp; ſanguis</hi> in unum teſtimonium conſentiunt.

Annot. in 1. Epiſt. Joann. c. 5.</hi> v. <hi>7.</hi>
                        </note> that the <hi>Arians,</hi> for this reaſon, were ſo far from retrenching ſome Words from the Text, that they added ſome thereunto: that, on the contrary, the Catholicks had taken away that which is ſaid of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, leaving only theſe Words, <hi>Theſe three are the ſame;</hi> which can do them no hurt, and which (as he thinks) were likewiſe added by the <hi>Arians.</hi> But all this is only founded on Conjectures: and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every one does reaſon according to his Prejudices, ſome will have the <hi>Arians</hi> to be the Authors of that Addition, and others do attribute the ſame to the Catholicks. This diverſity of Opinions proceeds from nothing elſe but a neglect of examining with ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent care, the ancient Manuſcript Copies and other Records which were neceſſary for the diſcovery of the Original of thoſe Variations. It would be to no purpoſe for me to repeat here the Critical Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which I have formerly made on that Paſſage of the firſt Epiſtle of St. <hi>John,</hi> it having been made evident in what manner it came to paſs that thoſe Words, that were neither in the <hi>Greek</hi> Copies nor in the <hi>Latin,</hi> were inſerted in the Text.</p>
                     <p>No credit therefore is eaſily to be given to all thoſe Accuſations of the ancient Eccleſiaſtical Writers againſt the Hereticks, upon the point of the Alterations that have happened to the Sacred Writings. We have already ſeen, in the Critical Hiſtory of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that the moſt part of the Fathers did caſt the ſame reproach on the <hi>Jews,</hi> without any ground. Seeing the moſt part of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies ſprung up in the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, thoſe who maintain the prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the <hi>Latin</hi> Copies of the New Teſtament, do not fail to bring this Reaſon, to ſhew that the Books of the <hi>Latins</hi> are more ancient than thoſe of the <hi>Greeks.</hi> But before this Accuſation is brought, it ought to be examined if theſe Objections have a good foundation: for if the thing be conſidered in general, the Original muſt needs be more perfect than the Verſions, unleſs it be in ſome places, where it may be demonſtrated that the Verſion is inſtead of the Original which has been altered.</p>

In the former Chapter, it was ſhewn from a Paſſage of <hi>Origen,</hi> that the Greek <hi>Amanuenſes</hi> who writ out the Books of the New Teſtament, and likewiſe the Criticks who corrected them, had aſſumed a very great liberty; and that that was the occaſion of a mighty confuſion.

                     <p>They were not ſo zealous at that time for the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue, but that they believed that the Original <hi>Greek</hi> was ſometimes ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, not only to regulate, but alſo to underſtand it. Upon this ground St. <hi>Jerom</hi> and St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> judged, that it was fit to correct the <hi>Latin</hi> in many places by the <hi>Greek,</hi> when the former happens to be defective. That the Original might be the more eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted, thoſe who were curious did joyn it in the ſame Copy to the ancient <hi>Latin</hi> Edition. Neither did <hi>Beza</hi> obſerve, that the <hi>Greek</hi> and the <hi>Latin</hi> of Manuſcripts of that ſort are written with the ſame hand, and that the <hi>Greek</hi> has a greater reſemblance of the ancient Capital Letters of the <hi>Latins</hi> than of thoſe of the <hi>Greeks.</hi> The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer are more ſquare, the great Letters of the <hi>Greeks</hi> are longer and finer. This I obſerved in reading the ſecond part of that <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi> Copy which is in the King's Library, and another the like Copy which is in the Library of the Religious <hi>Benedictines</hi> of St. <hi>Germain.</hi> Theſe two Copies, which contain the Epiſtles of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> do ſo little differ from one another, as well in the <hi>Greek</hi> as in the <hi>Latin,</hi> that it would ſeem the one had been copied from the other, but that the Characters of that of the <hi>Benedictines</hi> are greater and more majeſtical, and that it is leſs disfigured by Corrections. It may be eaſily known by the faſhion of the Characters of thoſe two Copies, and by the ancient <hi>Latin</hi> Verſion which is joined to the <hi>Greek</hi>
                        <pb n="131" facs="tcp:96711:158"/>Text, that they were copied by the <hi>Latins</hi> for the uſe of that Church. The <hi>Greek</hi> and the <hi>Latin</hi> are written with the ſame Hand, and with a Letter altogether alike; ſo that there are Letters that are purely <hi>Greek</hi> in the <hi>Latin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Moreover, there is one thing that is very ſingular in thoſe two Manuſcripts, and that can only agree to the <hi>Latins.</hi> It is certain, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> did reckon amongſt the number of the Epiſtles of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> that which is directed to the <hi>Hebrews;</hi> whereas many <hi>Latin</hi> Churches did not receive it. And this Epiſtle is not put with the others in thoſe two Copies. It is placed ſeparately at the end of the Book. Which cannot be accounted a Tranſpoſition, or any other thing of the like nature, chargeable on thoſe who joyned the Leaves of thoſe two Copies together. For the end and the beginning of every one of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles are there very exactly mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and in the ſame order as we read them at this day. Yet there is no mention made of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> becauſe the Churches of thoſe who made uſe of the Copies did not believe that it belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to S. <hi>Paul,</hi> nor that it was ſo much as Canonical. And for this reaſon they added, immediately after the Epiſtle to <hi>Philemon,</hi> a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of all the Books which were read in thoſe Churches; and this Epiſtle is not marked with others in the Catalogue. It is only found at the end of thoſe Books as foreign to the Work, and as a Piece that does not carry the ſame Authority with the others.</p>
                     <p>All this does evidently prove, that thoſe two Manuſcript Copies of S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles, which are of the ſame nature with that of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> which contains the Goſpels and the Acts of the Apoſtles, were not written by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> ſeeing all the Churches of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> that of the <hi>Arians</hi> only excepted, did always acknowledg the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> for Divine and Canonical, and which they never ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the reſt of that Apoſtle's Epiſtles. Nor can we believe, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> would joyn to their <hi>Greek</hi> Copies a <hi>Latin</hi> Verſion which they did not underſtand, and which was altogether unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to them. In ſhort, the numerous Faults that are in the <hi>Greek</hi> of thoſe Copies is a new proof that they were written by <hi>Latin Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuenſes,</hi> who had no knowledge of the <hi>Greek</hi> Language. I ſpeak not of the ſmall Orthographical Faults, which are obſerved in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Books that were copied by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> as well as in thoſe that were copied by the <hi>Latins;</hi> but of certain Faults in the Words which can only be applied to the latter, and of which I would produce ſeveral Examples, if I did not believe that it has been evidently proved, that the Manuſcripts of that nature, which were uſed in the We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern Churches, before S. <hi>Jerom</hi> amended his ancient <hi>Latin</hi> Verſion, were written by <hi>Latin</hi> Tranſcribers.</p>

                     <p>I found indeed theſe Words, <hi>Super triſtitiam,</hi> in that ancient Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, which is joyned to the <hi>Greek</hi> Text, in the Copy of the Royal Library, and in that of the Abbey of S. <hi>Germain.</hi> S. <hi>Jerom</hi> has kept them in his new Edition, according to the Method which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to follow, deſigning to amend that only which did change the ſence. If <hi>Eraſmus</hi> had contented himſelf to ſay, that they had been taken from another place of S. <hi>Paul, Ex alio loco Pauli adjecta,</hi> he would have had more reaſon; being certain that there are the like Additions in the ancient Copies, and alſo ſometimes in their ſyno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymous terms. For there we find in ſome places two Readings which the Tranſcribers have joined together, that nothing might be forgotten by them. If there had been cauſe to believe that the <hi>Greek</hi> had been amended by the <hi>Latin,</hi> that could be only true of the ancient <hi>Greek</hi> Copies which were in uſe amongſt the <hi>Latins</hi> before S. <hi>Jerom</hi>'s time, and not of thoſe of the latter Ages. But it is more probable that the <hi>Latin</hi> was amended by the <hi>Greek.</hi> I here ſpeak of the ancient <hi>Latin</hi> which was taken from the <hi>Greek</hi> Copies that were altered in ſo many places, that that Father was obliged to reviſe the <hi>Latin</hi> by other <hi>Greek</hi> Copies that were more correct.</p>
                     <p>Yet I can hardly believe, that the ancient Vulgar had all thoſe Faults at the beginning, the <hi>Greek</hi> Copies poſſibly not being as yet ſo corrupted, as they were afterwards.

The Criticks, eſpecially St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> in reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ancient Vulgar, did at the ſame time amend thoſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Greek</hi> Copies, with which he agreed entirely.

There are none to be blamed for that alteration of the Ancient Copies of the New Teſtament, but the Chriſtians and even the Orthodox, as it has been frequently obſerved after St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> who, in his Letter to Pope <hi>Damaſus,</hi> has taken notice of the change of which we now ſpeak. He ſays, that in thoſe days they took the liberty to amend the Goſpels by that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, which they had read firſt. <hi>Ille qui unum è quatuor primum legerat, ad ejus exemplum caeteros quoque exiſtimaverat emendandos.</hi> It is evident, that the Genealogy in St. <hi>Luke</hi> was reformed in the <hi>Cambridge</hi> Copy, according to this Method, and that what was ſuppoſed to be wanting therein, was ſupplied from the Old Teſtament. And the accuſation ſuppoſed to have been brought againſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> was ſo far from admitting a ſufficient ground of reaſon, that there was nothing at that time ſo common, as Copies, as well Greek as Latin of that kind, eſpecially in the Churches of the Weſt, before St. <hi>Jerome</hi> had reviſed the Ancient Latin Edition: It would be eaſie to prove, that the Goſpel of St. <hi>Mark</hi> has been likewiſe amended in ſome places, by that of St. <hi>Matthew;</hi> and further, that there have been ſome words chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for others that were ſynonymous, which appeared to be more intelligible; but that labour would be to no purpoſe, becauſe eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one may conſult the divers Readings of that ancient Copy in the ſixth Tome of the Polyglott Bible of <hi>England,</hi> and in the <hi>Greek</hi> Edition of the New Teſtament Printed at <hi>Oxford.</hi> It is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that I have obſerved the true reaſon of thoſe numerous vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, concerning which the Criticks have given us very wide, and even falſe conjectures.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe who reviſed thoſe ancient Copies, intending nothing but to make them clear, without being at the pains to confine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the true Reading of the Evangeliſts and the Apoſtles, have given Paraphraſes on them, whenſoever they believed that they were not ſufficiently underſtood. They have alſo abridged them in thoſe places that they thought intricate, by reaſon of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:96711:164"/>words, which they have alſo tranſpoſed in innumerable places for the ſame reaſon: Which is enough to be obſerved once for all, in general, without a particular rehearſal of the Paſſages, which have been altered in the <hi>Cambridge</hi> Copy, as well in the Goſpels, as in the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles. This does appear yet more in the <hi>Acts,</hi> becauſe there was a very great liberty taken of reforming that Hiſtory in the firſt Ages of the Church. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs whatever change thoſe Books have undergone in the ancient time, and that the very words of the Evangeliſts and the Apoſtles were not obſerved, yet it will not be found that the ſenſe has ſuffered any alteration. They only endeavoured to make them the more intelligible to the People, and for that end, it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to refine them, ſeeing they were full of <hi>Hebraiſms</hi> and very conciſe Phraſes, which they were obliged to illuſtrate according to that Method.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheleſs, in the <hi>Cambridge</hi> Copy there are certain Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions whereof the ſame thing cannot be ſaid, becauſe they are plain Matters of Fact that have been added.

And therefore thoſe who preſumed to reform the firſt Copies of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in ſo many places, upon the bare proſpect of rendring them intelligible to all the World, would not ſcruple to add thereto Hiſtories of that ſort, which they believed to be true.

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:96711:166"/>juſt now written. Thoſe who have a deſire to preſerve thoſe ancient Manuſcripts, ought to put leaves of Paper betwixt the leaves of the Parchment upon which the Writing is, to the end that the Ink may not wear off. They might at laſt have added to the end of thoſe Copies, a very ancient Catalogue of the Books of the Bible.</p>
                     <p>The ſtrongeſt proof in my Opinion for evincing the great anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of that Copy, is, that the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> is not reckoned with the reſt, in the number of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles, as I have formerly obſerved, but by it ſelf, and out of the Body of thoſe Letters that were read in the Church. F. <hi>Morin</hi> did not ſufficiently conſider that Manuſcript, when he ſays, (ſpeaking of the Catalogue, which is put at the end)<note n="(d)" place="bottom">Catalogus ille inſertus eſt codici ante Epiſtolam ad Hebraeos in paginis quibuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam fortuito vacuis. <hi>Mor. ibid.</hi>
                        </note> that they placed it before the Epiſtle to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,</hi> in ſome Pages where there was nothing written as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened. For that was done on purpoſe, the Epiſtle to <hi>Philemon</hi> being the laſt of the Copies of that ſort, which the <hi>Latins</hi> had writ out for their uſe. Seeing they did not believe, that the Epiſtle to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi> had been written by that Apoſtle, nor that it was Canonical, they did not joyn it to the other Epiſtles. And therefore they inſerted that Catalogue of the Books of Scripture immediately after the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Philemon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If <hi>Beza</hi> had conſidered the corrections that had been made in that Copy which he named of <hi>Clermont,</hi> he would eaſily have acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that Books of that ſort were never in uſe amongſt the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and that ſo it was not brought out of <hi>Greece,</hi> as he alledged. There are ſo many faults therein, eſpecially in the <hi>Greek,</hi> that it is manifeſtly ſeen, that it could not have been written but by a perſon who was altogether ignorant of that Language. A good part of thoſe faults were amended, and theſe were not only faults of the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy, but ſometimes of Words. They further reformed that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Verſion in many places, by other <hi>Greek</hi> Copies, which came nearer to theſe at this day. Which without doubt was done by ſome <hi>Latins,</hi> who corrected at the ſame time the ancient Vulgar, by St. <hi>Jerom</hi>'s new Edition.</p>
                     <p>We will not then, with <hi>Beza,</hi> charge the Obſervations that are placed in the Margins of that ſort of Copies, on the <hi>Greek</hi> Prieſts, but on thoſe of the Weſtern Church, who had ſome knowledg of the <hi>Greek</hi> Language. As thoſe Books paſſed through ſeveral Hands, ſo they have received amendments, ſome of which are more anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent than others. But after all, we ſtill ſee the ancient Readings, as well in the <hi>Greek</hi> as in the Latin, eſpecially in the Copy of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:96711:167"/>of St. <hi>Germain,</hi> which has been reviſed in ſo curious a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that the amendment does often conſiſt in nothing elſe but in ſmall ſtroaks of the Pen in the Letters. Seeing thoſe two Copies do differ in very few things, I ſhall in the following part of my Diſcourſe, make uſe rather of the latter, than that of the King's Library, which is more disfigured.</p>

                        </note> that the <hi>Clermont</hi> Copy upon St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles, does not ſo much vary from the ordinary Copies of the New Teſtament, as that of <hi>Cambridge</hi> does, and that it is alſo more agreeable to our Vulgar, though it is no leſs ancient than the other. The ſame thing is to be ſaid of that of the <hi>Benedictines</hi> of the Abbey of St. <hi>Germain,</hi> becauſe they are ſo much alike, that one would believe, that the one had been copied from the other. The reaſon of this great conformity of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles, in the <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> Copy with the ordinary <hi>Greek,</hi> and the Latin of the Vulgar is evident, becauſe he had no occaſion to amend thoſe Epiſtles by one another, as the Goſpels; and they were not ſo much neglected in the firſt Ages of the Church, as the Acts of the Apoſtles, which had been reviſed with a great deal of liberty in many places. Yet if we carefully examin the places where thoſe ancient Copies of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles, that were before St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> do differ from the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, we ſhall find that they were not reformed in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and according to the ſame method as the Goſpels and the Acts. We ſhall there obſerve the like Additions of Words, Synonymous Terms, ſeveral Readings joyned together, with Gloſſes annexed. Moreover, Tranſpoſitions are frequently found there: which would ſeem to have been done on purpoſe, to render the Senſe more clear, and alſo to avoid ſometimes the Hyperbates with which St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles are filled. There are alſo ſome places more abridged, than what are in the ordinary Copies. Whether it was that they intended to remove what was of no uſe, or that that is in truth the ancient Reading. For although thoſe Copies have been reviſed, they were amended throughout; and then they might repreſent the ancient Reading. To the end that they may be the better known, I ſhall here give ſome examples taken from the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and there may be a great many more obſerved in the ſecond Book of this Work, with reſpect to the Vulgar.</p>

                     <p>It may appear by the different Readings which we have now mentioned in the two preceding Chapters, how we are to judge of the ancient <hi>Greek</hi> Copies that were before St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> eſpecially in the Weſtern Churches, and to which the ancient <hi>Latin</hi> Verſion which was uſed in thoſe Churches was agreeable.</p>
                     <p>It is true that the Vulgar at this day does frequently agree with thoſe ancient <hi>Greek</hi> Copies; but it does alſo differ from them very often: and therefore it cannot be thought (according to the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of F. <hi>Morin</hi> and F. <hi>Amelote</hi>) that we muſt always prefer the reading of the Vulgar in thoſe places where it does agree with thoſe ancient Copies, ſeeing there are ſo many other places where it dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from them. If that <hi>Greek</hi> be the true Original of the Apoſtles, as thoſe two Authors ſeem to have inſinuated, it ought to be the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:96711:171"/>Original throughout, and we muſt conſequently entirely adhere to the ancient Vulgar which is exactly agreeable to it. Yet St. <hi>Jerom</hi> believed that it was abſolutely neceſſary to correct it, ſeeing it was very defective. If I were not afraid of being too tedious, I would here produce the various Readings of that ancient <hi>Greek</hi> Copy upon St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles, but I ſhall obſerve them more conveniently in the ſecond part of this Critical Hiſtory, when we ſhall examine the Verſion of the ancient <hi>Latin</hi> Interpreter, and ſhall take parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular notice of ſuch Places as agree with the ancient <hi>Greek</hi> Copies that were extant before St. <hi>Jerom.</hi>

                     <p>WE find in our Libraries ſeveral <hi>Greek</hi> Copies of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament which were written out by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and were in uſe amongſt them. Although they differ in ſundry places from one another, the moſt of thoſe differences are but of ſmall importance. They agree together in this, that they are very little like thoſe which we have laſt obſerved, that were copied by the <hi>Latins.</hi> This I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in reading many of thoſe Copies which are in the King's and in Mr. <hi>Colbert</hi>'s Library. It is true that I found none in thoſe two Libraries that were ſo ancient as thoſe other <hi>Greek</hi> Copies to which they joyned the ancient <hi>Latin</hi> Verſion which was before St. <hi>Jerom:</hi> yet this does not hinder but that there were ſome of the like Antiquity; but they are very rare. I believe that we ought to reckon the Copy of the <hi>Vatican</hi> in the number, of which ſome Criticks have made mention, and whereof they have alſo obſerved ſome different Readings in their Works.</p>
                     <p>The Copy which is commonly called the <hi>Alexandrine,</hi> becauſe it came from <hi>Alexandria</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> is likewiſe very ancient. Some of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, after <hi>Cyrillus Lucar,</hi> have obſerved that that Book which contains the Old and the New Teſtament in <hi>Greek</hi> was written, more than thirteen hundred Years ago by an <hi>Egy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptian</hi> Lady called <hi>Thecle.</hi> But they produce no certain proofs of this Antiquity. It was the Intereſt of the Patriarch <hi>Cyrillus,</hi> who
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:96711:171"/>made a Preſent of that Bible to the King of <hi>England,</hi> to make it as ancient as he could. There have been many <hi>Thecle</hi>'s, and they alſo gave that Name to ſome <hi>Roman</hi> Ladies, who retired into ſolitude in the Eaſt, where their great Piety was admired by the whole World: Theſe Ladies underſtood the <hi>Greek</hi> Language, and were curious to read the Holy Scripture in that Tongue. There were alſo Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries conſecrated to St. <hi>Thecle;</hi> and it might very well be, that that Copy belonged to ſome Monaſtery of that name: However it be, it cannot be denied, but that it is very ancient. Yet it differs from thoſe other <hi>Greek</hi> Copies, which were writ out by the Latins, as it is eaſie to judge by the various Readings, which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have Printed in their Polyglott Bible: <hi>Grotius</hi> has alſo made mention of a good part of thoſe various Readings upon the New Teſtament: We ſhall nevertheleſs obſerve, that this Critick is not always exact in his citations. In ſhort, I cannot give full aſſurance, that that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcript called the <hi>Alexandrine,</hi> and that of the Vatican, cannot be reckoned in the number of thoſe, which were writ out by Latin <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuenſes</hi> in thoſe Ancient times.</p>
                     <p>I make no queſtion, but that Cardinal <hi>Ximenes</hi> conſulted the moſt Ancient Copies of the New Teſtament, when he publiſhed his Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But it is to be feared, that ſome of the readings of thoſe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Copies were inſerted therein, under a pretext, that he found them more agreeable to our Vulgar. It is alſo poſſible, that <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen</hi>'s Copy, which was compared in <hi>Italy,</hi> with many <hi>Greek</hi> Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts, does likewiſe contain ſome readings of thoſe ſame Copies which were reviſed, and to which they annexed the Ancient Latin Verſion. The ſame judgment ought to be made of the Sixteen Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies, which the Marqueſs of <hi>Veles</hi> had conſulted, and whereof ſome do in many places, agree with our Vulgar: It is fit to make all theſe Obſervations in general, to ſupply in ſome ſort the negligence of thoſe Learned Men, who were not at the pains to give us particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar marks of diſtinction, to know what were good and what were bad amongſt their Manuſcripts. <hi>Eraſmus</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi> who had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſed ſeveral of thoſe <hi>Greek</hi> Copies, and who ſignalized their dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in this matter, were frequently miſtaken, when they ſpoke of their Manuſcripts. They were ignorant of the diſtinction, that we formerly mentioned, betwixt two ſorts of <hi>Greek</hi> Copies of the New Teſtament. For what remains, ſeeing I have given ſeveral exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the various readings that were writ out by the Latins, it will be very fit, to produce in this place, ſome inſtances of the various readings of other <hi>Greek</hi> Copies. And becauſe there have been ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral collections already made, whereby it may be known wherein thoſe variations do conſiſt; I ſhall confine my ſelf to ſuch as are the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:96711:172"/>principal of them, and upon which it will be needful to make ſome Critical reflections.</p>

                        <hi>Maldonat</hi> the Jeſuit, in his Commentary upon this place of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> did prefer <hi>Stephen</hi>'s Manuſcript or rather that of <hi>James le Fevre,</hi> to the ordinary <hi>Greek</hi> and to the Vulgar. He chiefly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on the Authority of St. <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> who alledged, that in that
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:96711:172"/>place, there was an error in the Vulgar <hi>Greek</hi> Copies; becauſe the Tranſcribers, who perceived, that the name of <hi>Jechonias</hi> was mark'd four times, did imagine with themſelves, that that repetition was ſuperfluous. I do agree (ſaith <hi>Maldonat</hi>) with St. <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> in his Opinion, that there was an omiſſion of the Tranſcriber in that place: Yet I do not reckon with him, that it does conſiſt in theſe words, <hi>Jechonias begat Jechonias,</hi> but in theſe, <hi>Joachim begat Jecho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias.</hi> — And therefore, I think that this place ought to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended thus; <hi>Joſias begat Joachim and his Brethren, about the time they were carried away to Babylon, and Joachim begat Jechonias.</hi>

                     <p>But notwithſtanding the Authority of ſome <hi>Greek</hi> Manuſcripts, which confirm this Reading, I am perſuaded that we ought to keep the ordinary Reading in the Text and in the Verſions, becauſe it is the moſt ancient and the moſt plain. That other reading was brought in by the Scholiaſts, who noted in the Margin of their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies, that one generation was wanting in that place; and at the ſame time they marked it in their Scholium or Marginal Note, which was afterwards put in the Text. Indeed St. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> does cite no ancient Copy, to give authority to his amendment: On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, he does ſuppoſe, that it was extant in the Copies of his Time, as it is in the ordinary <hi>Greek</hi> Copies at this day: He only ſays, that they who have a mind to conſult exact Copies, <gap reason="foreign">

But beſides that he makes mention of none in particular, he falls into manifeſt errors, and ſuch as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict the Hiſtory of the Old Teſtament: He ſeem'd to correct his Vulgar reading for no other reaſon, but becauſe, St. <hi>Matthew</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing divided the Genealogy of Jeſus Chriſt into three Claſſes, every one whereof ought to contain fourteen Perſons<note n="(d)" place="bottom">

S. <hi>Jerom</hi> has kept in his Edition, the ancient reading of ſome <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Copies. And thus <hi>Maldonat</hi> is miſtaken, when he would perſuade us, that that Father did correct the ancient Vulgar by the <hi>Greek</hi> Copies of his time, from which he had taken away <gap reason="foreign">

For the ancient <hi>Cambridge</hi> Copy does prove the contrary; beſides that the Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of S. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> does manifeſtly ſuppoſe, that they did not read <hi>palàm</hi> in ſome <hi>Latin</hi> Copies of the ancient Vulgar.

They did not then know what it was to mark with Points, Comma's and other Diſtinctions, which have been afterwards inſerted in Books to make the reading more eaſie and diſtinct. We ſhall further obſerve, that even ſince Diſtinctions of this nature have been in uſe, the moſt part of Tranſcribers did neglect them, as well as the Accents in the ancient <hi>Greek</hi> Manuſcripts.

This does not hinder but that Accents and Points or Marks of Diſtinction are much more ancient than theſe

Every one did moſt commonly, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his prejudices, mark that ſort of Diſtinctions, which depended on the Tranſcribers and the Expoſitors of the Scripture. And therefore <hi>Petavius</hi> after having obſerved what S. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> and ſome other ancient Doctors of the Church have brought againſt ſome Hereticks about the manner of pointing the third Verſe of the firſt Chapter of the Goſpel according to S. <hi>John,</hi> does add,<note n="(b)" place="bottom">Exiſtimo varietatem illam interpretationis ex librariorum aut interpretum diversâ ſententiâ profectam eſſe, non ex fraude ulla Pneumatomachorum, vel alio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum haereticorum. <hi>Petav.

                        </note> that that diverſity of pointing thoſe words of S. <hi>John,</hi> ought not to be attributed to the ill deſign of thoſe who denied the Divinity of the Holy Ghoſt, or to other Hereticks, but only to the different Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of the Tranſcribers and Interpreters.</p>

                     <p>The truth is, the Orthodox Authors do not always agree amongſt themſelves about it. It happens ſometimes, that the ſame Writer does differently point the ſame Paſſage in different places of his Works. And ſo there is nothing elſe but good Senſe and the Rules of Criticiſm that can direct us in our choice, in preferring one Punctation to another. I know we ought to follow the plurality of good Manuſcript Copies, and the conſent of Interpreters. For example, without taking notice of all that S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> has obſerved upon the manner of pointing the third Verſe of the firſt Chapter of the Goſpel according to S. <hi>John,</hi> we may read that Verſe after this manner <gap reason="foreign">

                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, is ſomewhat forced, and according to this punctation, it ought to be tranſlated, <hi>Without him nothing was made, that which was made had life in him.</hi> It is worth the while to obſerve, that many <hi>Greek</hi> Manuſcript Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies, have a point after the word <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, but that point anſwers to our comma, in thoſe Manuſcripts, which have two ſorts of points, the one truly anſwering to our point, and the other to that we call a comma.</p>
                     <p>Yet St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> does frequently maintain the diſtinction, that places the point after the word <hi>nihil:</hi> He further maintains, that this Paſſage is pointed after this manner in the moſt correct Copies. <hi>Quod factum eſt, in illo vita erat, that which was made, in him was life;</hi> ſo that there is not only a point to be placed after <hi>nihil,</hi> but alſo a comma after theſe other words, <hi>quod factum eſt. Sic ergo,</hi> (ſaith this Father) <hi>diſtinguendum eſt, ut cum dixerimus, quod factum eſt, deinde in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feramus, in illo vita eſt, non in ſe ſcilicet, hoc eſt in ſuâ naturâ.</hi>

                        </note> He condemns thoſe who placed a comma after the Pronoun <hi>illo,</hi> and who favoured their own prejudices by this punctation. But there appears commonly more ſubtilty than ſolidity, in Reaſonings of this ſort. For ſeeing every one does reaſon from certain Principles, which he ſuppoſes to be true, he points the Copies of the Scripture after his own faſhion. Thoſe diſputes had ſo divided the Minds of the Ancients of that time, that there were four different ways of
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:96711:182"/>pointing this Paſſage of St. <hi>John,</hi> whereas, at this day there is no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute about it.</p>
                     <p>This does inform us, that although the moſt part of Tranſcribers, did then neglect the points and the other marks of diſtinction; yet they were put for all that in ſome Copies. The Commentators on the Scripture obſerved them likewiſe in their Commentaries, when they judged it fit: But ſeeing they had not the firſt Original of the Evangeliſts and the Apoſtles, where thoſe marks of diſtinction were extant, there is nothing certain in this matter: We ought alſo to uſe precaution in reading the Writings of the Fathers, eſpecially when they diſpute againſt the Hereticks of their time; from whom they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved in their Opinions, as far as it was poſſible for them. Now, it is not neceſſary to inſiſt too nicely on this ſort of diſtinctions, and ſtops; there commonly needs but a little of good ſenſe, to make a due eſtimate of them. There is none for example, but will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn ſome of the Moderns, for the innovations they have made in our Age; who in favour of their own prejudicate Opinions, read, Chap. 23. of St. <hi>Luke,</hi> v. 43. <gap reason="foreign">

                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>day,</hi> whereas, according to the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Reading of the <hi>Greek</hi> Copies, whether Manuſcript or Printed, it ought to be placed after the Pronoun <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     </p>
                     <p>Beſides thoſe marks of diſtinction of which we have been ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, there is another which is common to all the ancient Books, and which is made by the means of Verſes. The Bulk of a Work did once appear, if the number of Verſes contained therein were ſumm'd up at the end: A Verſe was nothing elſe, but a Line that the <hi>Greeks</hi> called <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, ſo that, by numbering the Verſes, they diſcovered how many Lines were contained in any Volume. Yet ſome Criticks could not comprehend how they could, by thoſe Lines or Verſes, reckon the juſt content of a Book, becauſe the Parchments, upon which they writ, having been unequal, the Lines muſt needs have been ſo too; and ſo the number of thoſe Lines could not adjuſt the Bulk of a Work. This was that which <hi>Crojus</hi> brought againſt <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſabon;</hi> and withal he confirm'd his Opinion by the teſtimony of ſome Ancient Writers, by whom he pretended to prove, that the word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> does ſignifie an entire Period, or the ſeveral parts of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods.</p>
                     <p>But this Objection does fall by it ſelf, if we make a juſt reflection on thoſe Ancient Parchments, which compoſed Volumes or Rolls. Every Roll contained many Pages that were all equal, and in every
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:96711:182"/>Page there was a certain number of Lines; and laſtly, in every Line, there was a fixed number of Letters. And this is obſerved by the <hi>Jews</hi> at this day, in their Rolls, which muſt have a certain propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as well in length as in breadth: Moreover every Line ought to conſiſt of thirty Letters; and they called theſe Letters <hi>ſitta,</hi> which is the ſame thing with the <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and the <hi>verſus</hi> of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins. We are not to imagine, that the manner in which the <hi>Rabbins</hi> have divided the Bible, is of their own invention: They followed in that the practice of other Nations, as I have proved elſewhere. And ſeeing they have retained their ancient uſe of Rolls, we muſt learn of them, whatever belongs to the diviſion of the Rolls or Ancient Volumes.</p>
                     <p>Further, it is not hard to ſhew, how the meaſure of the Lines or Verſes might have been retained in the form of thoſe ordinary Books, in which the Parchments or Papers were unequal. For when the breadth of the paper could not contain a whole Line, they placed the reſt of the Letters or Words above the Line. It ſeems they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned in this manner, to write by way of Verſes, the Ancient <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Copy of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles, which is in the Royal Library, and that of the <hi>Benedictine</hi> Monks of the Abbey of St. <hi>Germain.</hi> Or rather, they who copied theſe two Manuſcripts by others that were more Ancient, did not at all underſtand the nature of the ancient Lines or Verſes; and therefore they did not altogether imitate the ſame. However it be, it is certain that there is nothing more ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary amongſt the ancient Writers, than to mark at the end of their Books, the number of Verſes which they contained.</p>
                     <p>I do not deny, but that there is another ſort of Verſes which were regulated according to the ſenſe, or the ſentences, in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as they are repreſented in our Books. In this we have imitated the <hi>Jews,</hi> who divided their Bible into this kind of Verſes. This latter ſort has an original quite different from that of the former: For ſeeing they did read the Scripture in their Synagogues and in their Schools, they made this new diviſion of Verſes for the conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency of their Leſſons. We alſo ſee ſomething of the like nature in ſome <hi>Greek</hi> Manuſcript Copies of the New Teſtament, and in ſome Manuſcript Church Bibles: I have not only obſerved the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and the ending of the Leſſons, which they called <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, which are as ſo many different Chapters, but alſo certain marks in form of a croſs in all the places where the ſentences do end, and where the Reader makes a little ſtop, according to the cuſtom of the <hi>Greek</hi> Churches. This we may call a Verſe or Sentence, and which the <hi>Greeks</hi> do ſignifie by the word <gap reason="foreign">

Thoſe who cannot conſult the Manuſcript Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies for this, ought to read the firſt <hi>Greek</hi> Editions of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament that were publiſhed by <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> or that were done by <hi>Rob. Stephen,</hi> which is in <hi>folio.</hi> Thoſe ten Canons are rank'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Goſpel under ten ſeparte Titles, and the Application there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:96711:185"/>is marked in the Margin of every Goſpel. The ſmall Sections are there noted by Letters inſtead of Numbers, according to the cuſtom of the <hi>Greeks.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Canons to which thoſe Sections do anſwer are marked by other Letters which do not exceed the number of Ten, which is the number of thoſe Canons, The Letters laſt mentioned ought to be read according to the method uſed by <hi>Euſebius,</hi> for diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them the more eaſily from the others: but <hi>Rob. Stephen</hi> has di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed them by a ſmall Stroke which is ſet over thoſe which mark the ſmall Sections. All this was alſo obſerved in the <hi>Latin</hi> Editions of the New Teſtament with great exactneſs. It is not neceſſary that I ſhould here produce Manuſcript Copies; it is enough to conſult the firſt Impreſſions of our <hi>Latin</hi> Bibles. Thoſe ten Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of <hi>Euſebius,</hi> with the ſmall Sections, are found as well at the beginning of the Goſpels as in the Margins of every Goſpel in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, in the ſame manner as in the <hi>Greek</hi> Copies. The Sections are marked by our common Figures 1, 2, 3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the Canons by the <hi>Roman</hi> Figures I. II. III. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It was hard for the <hi>Greek</hi> Tranſcribers who writ the Canons of <hi>Euſebius</hi> to commit no fault, by putting ſome Letters for others. Indeed in comparing ſeveral Manuſcript Copies of thoſe Canons, I found ſome difference amongſt them; which nevertheleſs is eaſily helped, unleſs it be in the places where the Copies do not agree about the number of Sections. If we conſult, for Example, the ten Canons, as they are in <hi>Rob. Stephen</hi>'s Edition, and the moſt part of the Manuſcripts, 'tis manifeſt that the twelve laſt Verſes of St. <hi>Mark</hi> were in the <hi>Greek</hi> Copies in the time of <hi>Euſebius.</hi> For he marks, in the tenth Canon, the Section <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> 234. of that Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt, and in the eighth the Section <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> 235. which are included in thoſe twelve Verſes.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheleſs, it might have been ſo, that thoſe two Sections were afterwards added to the Canons of <hi>Euſebius</hi> by thoſe who read thoſe twelve Verſes of St. <hi>Mark</hi> in their Churches: and ſo thoſe Canons could not be a certain Rule in that place, if it were not known, upon ſome other ground, that thoſe Verſes were extant in S. <hi>Mark</hi> before <hi>Euſebius. Marianus Victorius,</hi> who caus'd to be printed with St. <hi>Jerom</hi>'s Works thoſe ten Canons of <hi>Euſebius</hi> at the beginning of that Father's Commentaries upon St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> does, in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Canon, mark the 234 Section of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> and in the tenth, the 235 Section; yet he does only mark 233 Sections in the Margin of that Evangeliſt: and it is worth the Obſervation, that the 233 Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which is the laſt, does anſwer to theſe words, <hi>at illae exeun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> &amp;c. chap. 16. v. 8. as if all the reſt that followed of that Goſpel
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:96711:185"/>did not truly belong to St. <hi>Mark.</hi> This was inſinuated by S. <hi>Jerom</hi> in his Letter to <hi>Hedibia,</hi> where he ſays, that the moſt part of the <hi>Greek</hi> Copies had not this laſt Chapter,<note place="margin">Hieron. Epiſt. ad Hedib. qu. <hi>3.</hi>

However it be, it does not appear that <hi>Marianus</hi> did obſerve an Uniformity in this matter: for he does produce a greater number of Sections of St. <hi>Mark</hi> in the eighth and in the ninth Canon of <hi>Euſebius,</hi> than he has noted in the Margin of that Apoſtle. <hi>Baſle</hi>'s Edition of St. <hi>Jerom</hi>'s Works is more exact upon this matter; for there is an equal number of Sections,<note place="margin">Apud Frob. ann. <hi>1526.</hi>

Although theſe Leſſons are not much different from Chapters, if the Word Chapter be taken for Title, or a great Section, yet we are not to confound theſe two, as ſome Authors have done. There are fewer Leſſons than Titles or great Sections, as I obſerved in the reading ſome Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies where theſe Leſſons are mark'd exactly; and there are alſo ſome in which the Word <gap reason="foreign">

                        <hi>the beginning,</hi> are inſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to denote the end of one Leſſon and the beginning of another, which was taken from the <hi>Greek</hi> Church Bibles: and therefore we find in the Margins of thoſe Manuſcript Copies, not only the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maries of Sections, called Titles or Chapters, but alſo the days on which thoſe <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> Leſſons were to be read in the Churches. The <hi>Greek Amanuenſes</hi> have drawn Obſervations of this nature from their Church Bibles, and of them they compoſed a Table called <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naxarion,</hi> which they placed at the Beginning or the End of their Books. Seeing this does rather belong to the uſage of the <hi>Greek</hi> Churches than to the cogniſance of a Critick who treats of the <hi>Greek</hi> Copies of the New Teſtament, I ſhall inſiſt on it no longer: nevertheleſs, it is worthy of our Obſervation, that that diſtinction of different Leſſons, relating to the reading in the Church, has oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned ſome ſmall Alterations in ſome <hi>Greek</hi> Copies. They have taken away, for example, in certain places, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>'Tis not to be wondered that he has committed Miſtakes, having had the Misfortune to be brought up in the <hi>Church of</hi> Rome, which uſes the Holy Scriptures chiefly in order to corrupt them; equalling, if not preferring Traditions to them, founding its Infallibility on its ſelf, being ſupported by the intricate Juggles of the <hi>Canoniſts,</hi> and the Gibberiſh of the <hi>Schoolmen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>However, if his Alloy be diſliked, this Advantage may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, That the Learned of our Church, which pays a due reſpect to the Scriptures and uncorrupted Antiquity, and is accompliſhed with all kinds of Learning requiſite, will be hereby excited to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine on the Subject.</p>
